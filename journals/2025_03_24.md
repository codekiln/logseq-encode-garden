- ## [[MCP Server]] for Weather
	- A lot of people bemoan the fact that the official [[MCP/Doc/Quickstart/Server]] builds an [[MCP/Server]] that fetches the weather and gets alerts, as that's not something that developers that can code an MCP server usually need to do while coding. So this morning, to my surprise, I wanted to create a [[CursorAI/Project Rule]] to add the weather forecast to my weekly agenda in [[Logseq]], and was looking for a [[Good Enough, Quickly]] pre-made weather MCP server that would quickly work in cursor, and didn't see anything super obvious.
	- I remember that [[AIES 25 WS 1 - Building Agents with MCP - Mahesh Murag]] said that [[Anthropic]] was going to release an official MCP server registry (see also [[Latent Space/Blog/25/03/Why MCP Won]]), so I googled around a bit, but didn't find anything yet.
		- The list of [[MCP/GitHub/servers]] either in the `src` folder or in the root readme (which reads a bit like an [[AwesomeList]]) contain one.
	- I did see [[mcp-get.com]], which didn't have any "weather" results.
