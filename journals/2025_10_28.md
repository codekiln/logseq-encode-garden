			- I keep my configs within Docker volumes. There is an example:
			- `devcontainer.json` file
			- ```
			  {
			  "initializeCommand": ["init-host.sh"],
			  "mounts": [
			    "type=volume,source=devvolume-gcloud,target=/root/.config/gcloud"
			  ]
			  }
			  ```
			- `init-host.sh` file
			- ```
			  #!/usr/bin/env sh
			  set -e
			  
			  docker context use default
			  docker volume create devvolume-gcloud
			  ```

	- Q: How to disable `Cmd+\` keyboard shortcut in [[1Password]] desktop app?
		- This shortcut conflicts with some development tools (also reported conflicts with rich text editors, Google Docs, Keyboard Maestro)
		- ## Research Findings
			- `Cmd+\` is the **Lock 1Password** shortcut (not [[1Password/Quick Access]])
			- [[1Password/Quick Access]] uses `Shift+Cmd+Space` on Mac
			- According to [keyboard shortcuts documentation](https://support.1password.com/keyboard-shortcuts/), shortcuts can be customized in **Settings > General**
		- ## Solution
			- Navigate to **1Password > Settings > General**
			- Find the keyboard shortcuts section
			- **Leave the shortcut field blank** to disable it, or change to a different key combination
			- According to [1Password Community discussions](https://1password.community/search?q=keyboard+shortcut+conflict), users confirm "when I disable the 1Password shortcuts (by leaving them blank), the conflict resolves"
