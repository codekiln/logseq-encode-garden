- [[DevContainer]]
	- looking for a way to have some things different in [[GitHub/Codespace]] devcontainer config vs local
		- [[ChatGPT]] [thread about devcontainer local override](https://chatgpt.com/share/690079d9-2694-8000-9d56-ad9dd9ddef9c) downstream from [[DeepWiki]] discussion trying to validate approach of `devcontainer.local.json`

			- I keep my configs within Docker volumes. There is an example:
			- `devcontainer.json` file
			- ```
			  {
			  "initializeCommand": ["init-host.sh"],
			  "mounts": [
			    "type=volume,source=devvolume-gcloud,target=/root/.config/gcloud"
			  ]
			  }
			  ```
			- `init-host.sh` file
			- ```
			  #!/usr/bin/env sh
			  set -e
			  
			  docker context use default
			  docker volume create devvolume-gcloud
			  ```

- [[1Password]]
	- Q: How to disable `Cmd+\` keyboard shortcut in [[1Password]] desktop app?
		- This shortcut conflicts with some development tools (also reported conflicts with rich text editors, Google Docs, Keyboard Maestro)
		- ## Research Findings
			- `Cmd+\` is the **Lock 1Password** shortcut (not [[1Password/Quick Access]])
			- [[1Password/Quick Access]] uses `Shift+Cmd+Space` on Mac
			- According to [keyboard shortcuts documentation](https://support.1password.com/keyboard-shortcuts/), shortcuts can be customized in **Settings > General**
		- ## Solution
			- Navigate to **1Password > Settings > General**
			- Find the keyboard shortcuts section
			- **Leave the shortcut field blank** to disable it, or change to a different key combination
			- According to [1Password Community discussions](https://1password.community/search?q=keyboard+shortcut+conflict), users confirm "when I disable the 1Password shortcuts (by leaving them blank), the conflict resolves"
			- Created [[1Password/How To/Disable Keyboard Shortcut]] with detailed steps
- [[DevContainer]] Documentation Updates
	- Created [[DevContainer/Docker Compose/Concept/Using Docker Compose]] - comprehensive guide on using Docker Compose with DevContainers
		- Covers production file preservation, override files, sequential processing, and best practices
		- Includes examples of multi-container setups and service networking
	- Created [[DevContainer/Rust/How To/Configure Debugging]] - guide for configuring Rust debugging in containers
		- Documents required capabilities (`SYS_PTRACE`) and security options (`seccomp:unconfined`)
		- Covers both Dockerfile and Docker Compose configurations
		- Includes VS Code debugger setup and troubleshooting
	- Updated [[DevContainer]] main page with links to new documentation
- [[GitHub/Codespaces]] Documentation Created
	- Created comprehensive [[GitHub/Codespaces]] page for using GitHub Codespaces with long-running [[Claude Code]] sessions
	- **Key Findings for Long-Running Sessions**:
		- **CRITICAL**: Closing browser/editor does NOT stop the codespace - processes continue running
		- Perfect for AFK [[Claude Code]] sessions that can run up to 4 hours (240 min timeout max)
		- Timeout configurable from 5-240 minutes (default 30 min)
		- Must explicitly stop codespace to avoid charges
	- **Machine Types & Pricing**:
		- 2-core ($0.18/hr) to 32-core ($2.88/hr)
		- Recommended: 4-core or 8-core for [[Claude Code]]
		- 8-core = $0.72/hr = $2.88 for 4-hour session
		- Storage: $0.07/GB-month
	- **Free Quotas** (Personal):
		- GitHub Free: 120 hours compute + 15 GB storage/month
		- GitHub Pro: 180 hours compute + 20 GB storage/month
	- **Recommended Workflow**:
		- 1. Start codespace with 240-minute timeout: `gh codespace create --idle-timeout 240m`
		- 2. Launch [[Claude Code]] session
		- 3. Close browser/editor - session continues
		- 4. Reconnect later to check progress
		- 5. Explicitly stop when done: `gh codespace stop`
	- Documented machine types, lifecycle, persistence, environment variables, and billing
	- Added references to official documentation for all features
- [[Blog/Simon Willison/Claude Docs Best Practices]]
	- Created page for Simon Willison blog post on Claude documentation best practices
	- Key insight: Use `@AGENTS.md` in `CLAUDE.md` to maintain a single source of truth for agent configurations
	- Enables centralized configuration management and prevents duplication
