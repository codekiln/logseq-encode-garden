- #Idea for [[Claude Code/Skill]]
	- MCP to skill creator - [[MCP/skillgen]]
	- it would also be smart to make a skill that tells claude that it should git clone libraries and use that to figure out how they work and put notes in a scratchpad - something like knowledge management
- Discovered that [[GitHub/MCP]] now has a [[MCP/Server/Remote]] https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/remote-server.md which is awesome. The local version of the server has [[MCP/Tool/Dynamic Discovery]]; see [here](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-tool-discovery), but I don't think the remote server does yet? Also, there are multiple "toolkits," so you no longer have to load all of them.
	- All of this is really positive for the potential ability to use MCP with github in a way that's more context-efficient. But now we have a different problem; the configuration of the MCP server needs to match the configuration of the permissions for the [[GitHub Fine-Grained Access Token]], and that's a heck of a lot of bookkeeping to do when the tool configuration is likely different for each project and going to be different in terms of what you should do vs what AI should do!
- I wonder if there's any way to store all the components of a dotenv file in [[1Password]] and then generate it?
