- [[LangChain/Ecosystem]]
	- [[LangSmith/MCP/Server]]
		- use cases I hope to use an [[MCP/Server]] like this for
			- discursively creating and refining prompts
			- at an even higher level, creating an [[Agentic]] AI system which helps [[SME]]s do [[Eval]]-driven [[AI/Workflow]] and [[AI/Prompt]] prototyping and development
				- #Idea e.g. an agent creates a dataset, creates an evaluator, creates a prompt, iterates on prompt, converges.
					- I'm picturing a configurable [[langgraph/Studio]] application which can, upon discussion with an [[SME]], get a sense of the purpose of an [[AI/App]], and it would prototype it for them in an eval-driven way, inspired by [[TDD]].
