	- Maybe it's obvious, maybe it's not. We should be working more on targeted, paid agents.
		- Ex 1 - I keep seeing Claw Code in YouTube Transcripts. Maybe someone could create a targeted agent that would trawl through an AI transcription and clean-up incorrect transcriptions based on certain priors about the domain. For example, as a first step it would generate a summary of the target area, then generate a hypothesis about often miss-transcribed technical words or proper nouns, then clean it up.
		- Ex 2 - EdTech firms could work with universities and companies to develop repositories of paid agents that each have domain-specific, micro-topic insights. When you encounter a scenario in your business that you could use some insight on, you could rent an agent to look up the relevant theories and apply them to your situation.
			- In time, perhaps there might even be some sort of protocol inspired by BGP or Border Gateway Protocol  which would let companies negotiate sharing of their agents.
		- Basically every tool - whether it's a coding tool, a conceptual instrument, etc - could, over time, in the right setting be a specialized service that pays for itself over time.
