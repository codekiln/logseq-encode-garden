## Protecting the Concentration
	- [[Readwise/Reader/Preferences/Add to Feed]] and subpages.
		- ### On the benefits of #Hierarchy in #PKM
			- #[[My Side-Note]] I'm often thinking about how to migrate away from [[Logseq]], given that the product team has now put flat files and [[Markdown]] in a secondary support tier to prioritize their development of a [[Closed/Source]] [[Logseq/DB]].
				- I must admit, though, that the first-class hierarchy support with [[Logseq Namespaces]] is one of my favorite features, and it seems fairly rare in #PKM tools. In particular, it makes it really easy to maintain proxies of documentation on features that are usually placed within a hierarchy
- ## It's always Acronym-ious with AI
	- [[AI/Fine Tuning/Supervised]] aka SFT
	- [[AI/Reinforcement Learning/from AI Feedback]] aka RAFT
	- [[AI/Optimization/Policy/Proximal]] aka PPO
- ## #[[AI Knowledge Gardening]]
	- [[Logseq/Math]]
	- I had an #Idea today that perhaps I might utilize a pipeline where my flatfile Logseq gets imported into [[LogseqDB]] and then that product's enhanced support for [[NBB-Logseq]] could be used to create a web display that's more efficient than [[Logseq/Publish]]
- ## Freedom and/from Capitalism
	- Some inspirational stuff from [[Person/DHH]]
		- [[Once]] - an anti-SAAS manifesto about how we should still be able to buy things once
		- [[Writebook]] - a product made by Once which you can host on your own; it's made with [[Ruby/Rails]]. It's a stylish way to publish a [[Book]] online. It's also used by the [[Omarchy/Doc]]

- ## #[[AI Deep Research]]
	- [[Logseq/AI/Deep Research/Report/Github Action Idea]] - Created comprehensive research report surveying tools and precedents for building a GitHub Action that automates Deep Research using LangChain's OpenDeepResearch (LangGraph) for LogSeq Markdown pages tagged with `deep-research-prompt`. The report covers existing GitHub Actions patterns, integration approaches (containerized vs API-based), API aggregator options, security considerations, and provides a prototype workflow with recommendations for MVP and production implementations.
