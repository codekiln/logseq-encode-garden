- Created [[DevContainer/Ref/Key]] and [[DevContainer/Ref/Variable]] index pages with prototype entries for `onCreateCommand` key and `containerWorkspaceFolder` variable to document devcontainer.json configuration
- Updated [[JetBrains/DevContainer/Example]] with note about the specification examples folder containing examples of various devcontainer spec parts like `remoteUser`, `remoteEnv`, etc.
- Today I started using [[JetBrains/RustRover]] inside of a [[DevContainer]]
	- [[Keyshort]] Opt+Shift+Ctrl+C doesn't copy path / reference in such a way that Cmd+V pastes it
	- [Dev Container CLI | RustRover Documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rust/dev-container-cli.html?#build_container)
		- it turns out that jetbrains has [[JetBrains/DevContainer/ijdevc]] which is a [[CLI/Tool]] (that presumably wraps the canonical `dev-container` CLI or implements the spec independently)
			- I was unable to install it. Basically, the instructions didn't work out of the box so I gave up. I didn't try very hard because I was unconvinced that it would solve my problems or give me capabilities I needed.
- ## examples of projects with multiple [[DevContainer/.devcontainer.json]]s in the repo
	- [[DevContainer/Report/25/12/Multi-Env DevContainer Setup]]
	- [[TheRedGuild/GitHub/devcontainer]] some security-focused devcontainers, each in a sub-folder of `.devcontainer`
	- [[Mastodon/GitHub/mastodon/.devcontainer]] has a default `.devcontainer.json` and one focused on [[Codespaces]], each sharing a [[Docker/Compose/docker-compose.yml]]
	- [[Discourse/GitHub/discourse/.devcontainer]]
- [[Rust]] analysis and [[Performance]]

		- > InterpN achieves up to 200x speedup over the state of the art (Scipy) for N-dimensional interpolation.
