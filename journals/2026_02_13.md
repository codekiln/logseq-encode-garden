			- Discovered via `claude mcp --help` ithat `claude mcp serve` serves an MCP server *for claude itself*. Woah. [[Inception]] [[Recursion]]. It's not the first time I've heard of this, I think. There was a talk at [[OReilly/Event/25/09/AI Codecon]] that involved someone using MCP to control AI coding agents to use different models for comparing how they coded. Even so, I didn't know that it's now supported by Claude Code natively.
		- Updated [[Claude Code]] with research on session-specific MCP profiles (`--mcp-config` + `--strict-mcp-config`) and scoped MCP registration (`local`/`project`/`user`)
		- Researched auth reuse pattern for optional [[Atlassian/MCP]] sessions:
			- Shared auth is feasible via [[mcp-remote]] token cache (`~/.mcp-auth`) when URL/resource/headers are identical across sessions
		- Reviewed related existing KB notes:
			- [[MCP/Atlassian/Q/Can Atlassian authentication be system wide and cached]]
			- [[MCP/Atlassian/Q/Can I authenticate without loading the server into context]]
			- [[Claude Code/Settings]]
- [[iTerm2/Q/What does the Secure Keyboard Entry indicator mean]] created to capture what the "Secure Keyboard Entry" indicator means and what action to take
- Updated [[iTerm2/Q/What does the Secure Keyboard Entry indicator mean]] with researched explanation, impact, and troubleshooting steps for Secure Input ownership
- Created [[Person/Glen Maddern]] with bio, website, GitHub handle, and [[mcp-remote]] notes
- Created canonical [[mcp-remote]] page for [geelen/mcp-remote](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) with updated security evaluation:
	- Confirmed historical critical vuln `CVE-2025-6514` / `GHSA-6xpm-ggf7-wc3p` affected `<0.1.16`
	- Confirmed current npm latest `0.1.38` is outside affected range
	- Updated references to use [[mcp-remote]] across notes
