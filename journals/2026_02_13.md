	- AI has become the 2nd most divisive Rorschach test in public opinion, just behind the political elephant in the room.
	- Stanford puts out an annual study of public sentiment about AI ([AI Index 2025: State of AI in 10 Charts | Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-index-2025-state-of-ai-in-10-charts)) and the US ranks higher in nervousness and lower in excitement about AI than other countries.  Other surveys show similar results ([Google Ipsos poll says Americans wary of AI](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/18/google-ipsos-poll-ai-global-americans), [Views of AI Around the World | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/10/15/how-people-around-the-world-view-ai/)).
	- Whenever I go to talks that prominent individuals give, it seems like the vast majority of the Q&A is basically "holding people of power to account for what they're doing to us."
	- AI has become the trendiest scapegoat in the room, and tech absolutely, 100% needs to address this head on. I recently heard [this take](https://x.com/balajis/status/1995184984366428526):
	- > 2020: blue and tech against red
	  2024: red and tech against blue
	  2028: blue and red against tech

			- Discovered via `claude mcp --help` ithat `claude mcp serve` serves an MCP server *for claude itself*. Woah. [[Inception]] [[Recursion]]. It's not the first time I've heard of this, I think. There was a talk at [[OReilly/Event/25/09/AI Codecon]] that involved someone using MCP to control AI coding agents to use different models for comparing how they coded. Even so, I didn't know that it's now supported by Claude Code natively.

			- Researched auth reuse pattern for optional [[Atlassian/MCP]] sessions:
				- Shared auth is feasible via [[mcp-remote]] token cache (`~/.mcp-auth`) when URL/resource/headers are identical across sessions
			- Reviewed related existing KB notes:
