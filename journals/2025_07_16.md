## [[Prompt Engineering]]
	- [[Reddit/User/SaulFontaine]] [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1k932ph/comment/mpm117d/) that there is an order to the prompting components for [[AI/LLM]]s, and that later prompts that try to modify behavior can be "shadowed" by earlier prompts. They are specifically referring to [[OpenAI]] here.
		- > Here is roughly how the pieces get stitched together from highest to lowest priority:
			- > 1 - OpenAI's built-in system prompt ("You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI...")
			- > 2 - Customer-supplied system message (if you are using the API and inject one)
			- > 3 - Developer message(s) (the instructions the product team gave)
			- > 4 - Memory/context layers (persistent memories, user bio)
			- > 5 - User-preference prompts (your typography and style rules)
			- > 6 - Recent conversation turn(s)
			- > 7 - Current user query
			- > 8 - OpenAI's rollout-level "finalizing" instructions and decoding defaults
		- > It looks like the typography rules you supply at step 5 can get overshadowed by the built-in system prompt at step 1 or by step 8's decoding defaults (where smart-quote normalization lives). To permanently override that you need to elevate your ASCII-only rule into the very first system message. For example:
		- > System message: All output must use only ASCII punctuation. Do not apply any smart-quote or typographic substitutions. Replace any U+2018, U+2019, U+201C or U+201D characters with the ASCII single quote (') or double quote (") before finalizing output.
