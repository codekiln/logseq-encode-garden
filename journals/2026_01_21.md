		- Summary: Article discusses using proxy-based techniques to prevent secrets from being exposed to Claude Code. Key points include routing HTTP traffic through proxies (like mitmproxy) to intercept and replace API keys at the proxy boundary, so Claude never sees real credentials. Also covers integration with Formal's infrastructure for least privilege access controls, fine-grained policies, and the trade-offs between security and setup complexity.
