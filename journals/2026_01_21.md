	- [[FormalCo/Blog/26/01/Using Proxies to Hide Secrets from Claude Code]] by [[Person/Drew Gregory]]
		- Summary: Article discusses using proxy-based techniques to prevent secrets from being exposed to Claude Code. Key points include routing HTTP traffic through proxies (like mitmproxy) to intercept and replace API keys at the proxy boundary, so Claude never sees real credentials. Also covers integration with Formal's infrastructure for least privilege access controls, fine-grained policies, and the trade-offs between security and setup complexity.
- [[Book/The Nature and Art of Workmanship]] by [[Person/David Pye]]
	- Classic book about how things are made and how quality emerges from process. Core idea: workmanship is defined by the degree of risk—either "workmanship of certainty" (guaranteed outcomes through constrained processes) or "workmanship of risk" (quality depends on maker's skill and judgment). Relevant to software engineering: CI/CD, type systems, codegen = certainty; "hero coding" = risk.
