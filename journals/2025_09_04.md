## AI
	- #Thought
		- AI is a "plausibility engine" - it generates things that are "plausible." Many things that are plausibly described are real, but not all of them, and not uniformly. A lot of people haven't figured out how to make this property useful to them. They think they understand how to use an AI that's driven by a "truth engine," but they haven't yet taught themselves to find utility in an AI that's a "plausibility engine."
		- Those who do learn to drive the plausibility engine vehicle will go many places, some of which are much farther away than they could have visited on their own. Those who sit around complaining about how cool it would be if we had a flying "truth engine" car will likely not get very far powered by AI.
