		- Some great gems in here. I suppose I took away about a dozen things. Still need to type up my takeaways and point them here.
- ## AI
	- #Thought
		- AI is a "**plausibility** engine" - it generates things that are "**plausible**." Many things that are plausibly described are correlated with reality or real truth, but not all of them, and not uniformly.
		- A lot of people haven't figured out how to make this property of **plausibility** useful to them. They think they understand how to use an AI that's driven by a "**truth** engine," but they haven't yet taught themselves to find utility in an AI that's a "plausibility engine."
		- Those who do learn to drive the **plausibility-engine e-skateboard** will go many places, some of which are much farther away than they could have visited with their own feet. Those who sit around complaining about how cool it would be if we had a **flying "truth engine" e-skateboard** will likely not get very far powered by AI - that's just not the AI we have right now.
