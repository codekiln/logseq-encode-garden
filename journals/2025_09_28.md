- [[MacOS/Keyshort/Turn Dock hiding on and off]]
	- Dock hiding appeared to be interfering with setting Cmd+Alt+D for [[VSCode/Keyshort/Delete Line]], but even after turning it off, I wasn't able to set this keyboard shortcut in [[VSCode]]; the keyboard shortcut recording dialog would register Cmd+Alt but not Cmd+Alt+D.  It does record all other Cmd+Alt+XYZ that I tried, though.
