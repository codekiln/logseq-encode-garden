- ## [[GraphRAG]]
	- quotes from colleague using [[Microsoft/GraphRAG]]
		- GraphRAG is famous for being expensive
			- alternative is [[LightRAG/Paper]] [[2410.05779] LightRAG: Simple and Fast Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05779)
				- instead of 600 calls it just needs one
				- just testing them, it's better than naive rag
				- did it with [[AI/Model/Quen/2.5/7B]] quen2.5 7b
		- compares it to [[OLAP]]
