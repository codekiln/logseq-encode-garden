- [[Claude Code/How To/Install]] created to document the new native installer for Claude Code, replacing the npm-based installation method. Insight via [Claude Code's New Default Subagents by Ray Amjad on YouTube](https://youtu.be/TOs0DRBcdRs?t=15). Other highlights:
	- New planning sub-agent: Planning now runs in its own sub-agent to save context; invoked automatically in planning mode and can be triggered manually as agent-Plan under the built-ins (alongside agent-Explore)
	- Resume sub-agents: You can explicitly resume a previously spawned sub-agent session and see in the transcript that it resumed instead of creating a new one
	- Model auto-selection for sub-agents: If you omit the model on a sub-agent, Claude can choose an appropriate model automatically (though you noted you prefer to set models explicitly)
