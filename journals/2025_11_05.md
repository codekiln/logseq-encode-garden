- [[AI/Cognitive/Science/Report/25/11/Understanding as Compression]] created - deep research report surveying foundational and contemporary academic literature on the proposition that "understanding is compression and compression is understanding," covering Kolmogorov complexity, Minimum Description Length (MDL), Information Bottleneck theory, predictive processing, and philosophical analyses from cognitive science, philosophy of mind, and AI research
- [[Claude Code/How To/Install]] created to document the new native installer for Claude Code, replacing the npm-based installation method. Insight via [Claude Code's New Default Subagents by Ray Amjad on YouTube](https://youtu.be/TOs0DRBcdRs?t=15). Other highlights:
	- New planning sub-agent: Planning now runs in its own sub-agent to save context; invoked automatically in planning mode and can be triggered manually as agent-Plan under the built-ins (alongside agent-Explore)
	- Resume sub-agents: You can explicitly resume a previously spawned sub-agent session and see in the transcript that it resumed instead of creating a new one
	- Model auto-selection for sub-agents: If you omit the model on a sub-agent, Claude can choose an appropriate model automatically (though you noted you prefer to set models explicitly)
