- ## Logseq and rulesync
	- Updated all rulesync rules and commands to use editor-neutral rule references - removed all `mdc:` prefixes and file extensions from rule-to-rule references, making them compatible with any AI coding assistant that uses rulesync. Changed references from `[logseq-flavored-markdown](logseq-flavored-markdown.md)` to `the logseq-flavored-markdown rule` format.
