		- I'm now starting to understand why for a perfectionist's language, Rust code tends to be less [[DRY]] than some other languages like [[Haskell]].

		- This morning I got in early and had two or three tries at using [[Git Worktrees]] to do work with [[Claude Code]]. Even though I've been relatively successful lately using a [[DevContainer]] to do 3-5 trees, I'm finding that docker and the devcontainer crash more and more when I'm doing unattended coding on Rust. I think it might have to do with rust extensions doing type checking in the IDE on the various worktrees while the source code is changing, and Docker bumping into its memory limit. But I'm a bit surprised that 16 GB of [[RAM]] wasn't enough. It could also have to do with switching to [[Cargo/nexttest]], which has a higher CPU burden. With one worktree active in claude code, I'm at 5.34 GB of container memory usage. Within 10 min it was up to 10GB.
