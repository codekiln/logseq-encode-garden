				- my op
					- I'm looking for an open source program I can quickly activate to look up prompts, emojis or text snippets. I would prefer the lookup to support fuzzy matching and provide incremental suggestions.
					- Some people recommend text expanders for this purpose, but I'm reluctant to use programs that intercept keystrokes; see also [https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12wb55l/lets\_talk\_text\_expanders/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12wb55l/lets_talk_text_expanders/) where the assumption in the comments is that all text expanders function as keyloggers and are therefore a security risk.
					- Certainly there must be some class of organized, quick-look-up text tools that \*don't\* function as keystroke interceptors, and are instead operated by entering a command to activate another program, then entering input in the 2nd program and getting back a result.
					- After looking around a bit, it seems like MOST of the popular text expanders intercept keystrokes. Virtually all the options recommended in [https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1h1j6ra/best\_text\_expander\_alternative\_heading\_into\_2025/](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1h1j6ra/best_text_expander_alternative_heading_into_2025/) are keystroke interceptors.
					- For example, one of the more frequently recommended options, espanso, intercepts keystrokes: [https://espanso.org/docs/get-started/#understanding-matches](https://espanso.org/docs/get-started/#understanding-matches) .
					- It seems like the command line might be the most favorable candidate for this; one can set a global hotkey for a terminal, then quickly activate it and enter a command. Zsh supports fuzzy matching. Certainly someone has connected the dots into a program or a framework. What recommendations do you have in this direction?
					- I'd prefer options that are aimed at technical users in security-conscious settings.
					- I came to write this post after creating my first oh-my-zsh zsh autocompletion plugin [codekiln/macos-system-settings-zsh-completions: zsh plugin for opening up MacOS system settings](https://github.com/codekiln/macos-system-settings-zsh-completions/), and realizing that zsh could probably do everything that I need it to do. I realize I could probably start developing a solution myself, and I very well may in time, but first I'd like to get a sense of the prior art in this area.
