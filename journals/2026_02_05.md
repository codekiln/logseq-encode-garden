## Tools in the [[AI]] Era
	- [fluid.sh](https://www.fluid.sh/)
		- Claude Code for infrastructure. Debug, act, and audit everything Fluid does on your infrastructure.
- ## Terminology
	- [[Tool/3rd Party]] heard of this referred to as `3P`
- ## AWSmanship
	- For [[AWS]], they are using a definition of [[AI/Agent]] that's more in line with [[Person/Sam Altman]]'s definition of taking action in the world.
	- [[Amazon/Bedrock/AgentCore]]
		- Added [[Strands]] — open-source SDK for building AI agents, released by AWS in 2025
		- [[Strands/Agent/SOP]] aka Eval SOP
			- markdown-based instructions that guide AI agents through complex, multi-step tasks
			- SOP = System of Procedures
			- [[RFC/2119]] constraints like MUST, SHOULD, etc
			- a bit like [[Skills]]
		- [[AI/Memory/Episodic]]
			- enables learning from past debugging sessions
				- situation, intent
				- steps, outcome
				- agent episodic memory can be automatically extracted
	- [[Stream/ing/Bi-directional]] - an [[AI/LLM/Technique]]
	- [[AWS/Nova/2/Sonic]]: Speech to Speech foundation model
	- Web [[AI/Grounding]]
	- AWS has a new web automation session that lets you test things
		- [[AWS/Nova/Act]]
	- [[AWS/ECS/Express]]
		- like [[AWS/AppRunner]]
	- [[AWS/Lambda/Durable Functions]] are like [[AWS/Step Function]]
		- you can resume these
		- you can wait for the response - a major sea change on how to you use it. instead of getting 30 or 60 min lambdas, you'll get durable functions against
	- [[AWS/Lambda/Rust]] is now supported! Generally Available [[Rust]]
	- [[AWS/S3/Table]]s - like Iceberg tables in S3 - [[Parquet]] and [[Iceberg]] (both from [[Apache]])
	- [[AWS/S3/Vector]]s are a big cost savings opportunity
	- [[AWS/Backup]] Air-Gapped vaults ... how does this work?
	- Database
		- savings plans
			- requires generation 7 and above
		- [[AWS/Aurora]] now has automatic redaction
		- [[OpenSearch/Semantic Enrichment]]
	- AI-powered root-cause workflow using the five why's
	- [[AWS/API/Gateway/MCP]]
	- [[AWS/IAM/Policy/Autopilot]]
	- [[AWS/IAM/Outbound]] tokens
	- [[AWS/IAM/Temporary Delegation]]
		- if a partner or a student needs elevated permissions for an elevated time, you can granted
	- [[AWS/Secrets Manager/External Secrets]]
		- partner rotation code (hosted SAAS)
	- AWS login is getting easier
	- AWS WAF now supports Web Bot Auth (WBA)
	- [[kiro.dev]]
		- [[AI/Coding/Technique/Spec-Driven Dev]]
- ## [[CLI/Craftsmanship]]
	- [[tmux]]
		- Added [[tmux/Keyshort/Pane/Focus Next Pane]] and [[tmux/Keyshort/Pane/Rotate Panes]] — easy to confuse since `Ctrl+b, o` vs `Ctrl+b, Ctrl+o`
		- Added [[tmux/Q/How do I switch between tmux sessions?]] — three ways to switch sessions: `switch-client` from within tmux, detach+attach, or direct attach from outside; `Prefix+s` is the easiest
	- Added [[Lazygit/Keyshort/Pull]]
- ## [[Person]]
	- Created [[Person/Sam Altman]] — CEO of [[OpenAI]], former president of [[Y Combinator]]
- ## [[Security]]
	- Created [[Security/ABAC]] — Attribute-Based Access Control article covering how ABAC differs from [[Security/RBAC]], key components (PEP, PDP, PIP, PAP), and cloud implementations in [[AWS/IAM]], Azure, and GCP
