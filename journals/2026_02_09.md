		- [[tmux]]
			- Starting to get to know `:set-window-option synchronize-panes` which lets me then do `. ~/.zshrc` which I likely need to do once per day in each of my panes.
			- [[AI]] told me that when you do `:source-file ~/.tmux.conf`, it reloads the config across the entire tmux server. So, in theory, if I had two iterm windows with two tmux sessions and I ran the command in one, it would refresh it in the other. Not yet convinced this is the case, as it's a rather unique model for CLI interactions.

		- [[dotfiles]]
			- for the umpteenth time, started working on a dotfiles setup, this time using [[chezmoi]].
			- I added [[CodexCLI]] and wondered, where do I add this system / terminal dependency? normally I'd codify this in a [[DevContainer]]. I used to install stuff like this using [[ansible]], and in the last year I've also used [[mise]] for this.

			- Updated with `#card` flashcards for `y` modal and its sub-options
