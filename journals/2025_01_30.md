			- You can manually add the .cursor/rules folder and new .mdc files in the second root folder for now. It is a bug that we don’t support multi-root workspaces for this yet I will fix
			- Actually that may not work at all. Wait until the next release, sorry
			- Open two instances of cursor, one pointing at frontend folder and the other at backend folder then create ya rules.
			- Have a third instance open for when you need cursor to see both folders.
			- I did some testing and am unclear how the agent views cursorrules. Based on my testing it doesn't have access to cursorrules at all - I created a .md file and add that to the context myself. I'd recommend going that route - create two files and add to context as needed.

			- Anyways I just put together these two files from that work and popped them in the \`.cursor/rules\` directory and let them rip on one of my test projects and wow!
			- It was able to 1-shot something that would have taken many prompts before and thats including when I used the Docs symbol [like we used to recommend](https://docs.convex.dev/search/using-cursor).

			- Good question - OP:
				- I never used AI assistants for code except as an occasional alternative to Google/Stack-Overflow/Reddit. But after looking at Cursor a bit during the last weeks, I think it could be really useful if managed well.
				- I know how to use it through documentation and trial and error, but would like to go deeper and the quirks and tricks for it, along best practices. But everything I'm finding in YT are either hyperbolic influencer videos a-la "Watch me build an entire fullstack app in 20min without knowing how to code" or very simple demos about the basic commands.
				- Is there anything with more substance and deep?
			- post 1
				- The best way I have been using it is with prompt files and SOPs.
				- I find it a lot like painting where all the works in the prep.
				- I make files for front end instructions, back end instructions, how the database should be used, etc.
				- Create files for features I'm adding, pretty much everything.
				- I have a standard set I import into every project and then I make custom ones tailored to that project.
				- Another way I really like using it is writing in pseudo code and then having it generate the actual code.
				- Useful tool and definitely speeds up workflow.

			- comment
				- I recently discovered that developing a really detailed prompt describing your coding style, libraries that you want to use, naming conventions you want the ai to follow etc about a topic and uploading it either to a github repo or a gist really helps you to organize your prompts. you can than feed the doc crawling feature of cursor with the url to your prompt and use it like @aws-expert to inject the prompt at the beginning of a new chat. this allows the context to be short and highly improves the responses you get. you might want to take a look at the patterns directory in [this](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) repo for inspiration.

				- I was looking for the same thing and was bout to build a pipeline for PR review, but that is actually not necessary. In Cursor Chat, you can use @PR to reference it and add some instructions that serve your needs.
				- Here’s how I do it:
					- ```
					  @PR (Diff with Main Branch) 
					  Please analyze the code changes and provide the following information:
					  
					  1. **Intent and Purpose**: Summarize the goal of the changes. Explain what functionality or behavior the changes aim to introduce, modify, or fix.
					  
					  2. **Potential Issues**: Identify any possible problems the changes might introduce, such as:
					     - Bugs or unintended side effects.
					     - Performance concerns.
					     - Code quality issues (e.g., readability, maintainability, scalability).
					     - Violations of best practices or standards.
					  
					  3. **Suggestions for Improvement**: Recommend any improvements or alternative approaches that could enhance the code.
					  ```

			- OP mentions two ways
				- ```
				  1.	Using the AI Review feature:
				  •	Enable it in Settings > Beta > AI Review
				  •	Select “Review diff from Main Branch” option
				  •	Add custom review instructions for the AI
				  
				  2.   Using the Chat/Command approach:
				  •	Use Cmd+K
				  •	Reference the diff using @git
				  •	Ask for specific review feedback
				  ```

				- If you’re coming here from Google, and want to know where your notepads are saved, here are my findings.
				  TL;DR (sorry, windows - throw this into Claude for Mac equiv)
				  Notepads are stored in `AppData/Roaming/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage/{some_uuid}/state.vscdb` - There are many workspace folders so grab a DB browser for sqlite and find yours.
				- >
				- Look at the size of the state.vscdb to determine if it’s worth checking out.
				- The key you’re looking for is `notepad.reactiveStorageId`, or `notepadData`, where all your notepads are kept.
				- I’ll update this post as I go but please, give it a like so it gains visibility. (Or more likely, I’ll update the write up on LinkedIn ["Reversing" Cursor: Editing Notepads in Cursor w/ SQLite & other hacks.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/editing-notepads-cursor-doug-silkstone-c0rhe))
				- Notepads are an incredible feature that enhance the output quality and let you harness literal LLM magic. I rarely use composer without one of my many notepad templates.
				- TL;DR
				  `AppData/Roaming/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage/{some_uuid}/state.vscdb` → `notepad.reactiveStorageId` / `notepadData`.
				- Both are copies so…
				- It goes without saying, if you’re going to edit DB files then back everything up! (they already do this with `.vscdb.backup` but make backups of your live.)

	- #Tip [[Reddit/ChatGPTCoding]]
		- [How to Use Cursor More Efficiently! : r/ChatGPTCoding](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1hu276s/how_to_use_cursor_more_efficiently/) [[2024/12]]
			- Here are some methods I've found useful in my own usage for getting more accurate, precise, and efficient AI responses:
			  
			  **1) .cursorrules**
			  The `.cursorrules` file contains project-specific instructions that are always in the AI's context. Adding custom rules helps AI provide better, more relevant suggestions.
			- Example: *"Always use strict types instead of* any *in TypeScript."*
			- More examples: [[CursorAI/Sites/cursor.directory]] 
			  
			  **2) Pre-prompt**
			  In Cursor settings, under "Rules for AI," you can define custom instructions to refine AI responses:
			- Keep answers concise and direct
			- Suggest alternative solutions
			- Avoid unnecessary explanations
			- Prioritize technical details over generic advice
			  
			  **3) Code Index**
			  AI relies on your code index to understand your project. If you're frequently adding or deleting files, outdated indexing can lead to incorrect suggestions.
			- AI might reference old files and produce incorrect code
			- Manual resyncing keeps AI aware of your latest changes
			- Go to Cursor Settings > Resync Index to update it
			  
			  **4: Reference Open Editors**
			  For AI to stay focused, only relevant files should be added to the context.
			- Close unnecessary tabs
			- Open only the files you need
			- Use / Reference Open Editors to quickly add them to context
			  
			  **5) Notepads**
			  Notepads let you save frequently used prompts, file references, and explanations for quick reuse. Instead of manually re-explaining things, simply call a Notepad.
			- Document feature setups (e.g., "How to Add a New API Route")
			- Store common prompts like code reviews or security checks
