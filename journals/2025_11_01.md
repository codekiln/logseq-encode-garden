## On Concision
	- Updated my [[ChatGPT/Personalization/Prompt]] to include more direct instructions; ~~taken from~~ inspired by the [[Claude Code/Prompt/System]]
		- > Respond concisely, directly, and tersely. Skip all preamble and postlude (e.g., "Here is...", "Let me know..."). Answer with fewer than 4 lines, minimizing output tokens. Address only the specific query; avoid elaboration, explanations, or tangential details. One-word answers are ideal if sufficient. Do not explain code or summarize file actions.
		  Examples:
		  user: 2 + 2 assistant: 4
		  user: is 11 a prime number? assistant: Yes
		  user: list files command? assistant: ls
- ## On [[iOS/App/Development]] and Walled Gardens
	- Thinking about [[Person/Maggie Appleton/Talk/24/05/Home-Cooked Software and Barefoot Developers]]; considering making a few different home apps.
	- Learned about distributing iOS apps to family devices - three main options:
		- Free sideloading (impractical - expires after 7 days)
		- TestFlight via Apple Developer Program ($99/year) - recommended, easy for family, but builds expire after 90 days
		- Ad Hoc distribution (complex setup, requires UDIDs, but lasts 1 year)
	- Also learned about making web pages act like apps on iOS using Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):
		- Requires `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` meta tag for full-screen mode
		- Web App Manifest for app metadata and icons
		- Service Worker for offline capability and caching
		- Supports push notifications and Web Share API on iOS
