# Journals Directory - Instructions for Claude

## Directory Purpose
This directory contains daily journal entries in the Logseq knowledge graph, organized by date in the format YYYY_MM_DD.md (e.g., 2025_09_08.md).

## Journal Structure
Each journal file follows these conventions:

1. **Date-based Organization**:
   - Files are named YYYY_MM_DD.md
   - Each file represents a single day's notes, thoughts, and findings

2. **Content Structure**:
   - Journal entries use Logseq Flavored Markdown (LFM)
   - All content, including headings, must be prefixed with bullet points (`-`)
   - Content is typically organized by topics with proper heading hierarchy
   - Topics are often linked to main pages using the `[[Page Name]]` syntax

3. **Common Elements**:
   - Topic headers (e.g., `## [[AI/Coding]]`) grouping related content
   - References to other pages with `[[Page Name]]` links
   - Tags with `#tag` syntax
   - Block references and IDs for cross-referencing

## Working with Journal Entries

### When Adding New Content
1. Always use the correct date format for the filename
2. Follow the existing structure and heading patterns
3. Use proper Logseq Flavored Markdown with bullet points and indentation
4. Link to existing pages rather than creating new concept descriptions
5. Add content under appropriate topic headers

### When Searching Content
1. Look for patterns across multiple journal entries
2. Pay attention to recurring topics and tags
3. Notice connections between journal entries and main pages

### Important Notes
- Journal entries reflect daily thoughts and findings, often with evolving ideas
- Content is sometimes moved from journals to dedicated pages over time
- Recent journal entries may contain the most up-to-date information on current interests

## Recent Journal Themes
Recent journal entries (as of September 2025) focus on:
- AI coding tools and practices
- Audio and sound-related topics (Ableton, Max for Live)
- AI copyright issues and settlements
- Person pages for notable developers

## Reference
Always refer to the main CLAUDE.md file in the repository root and follow Logseq Flavored Markdown formatting rules precisely.
