				  js: ------------------------------------------------------------------

- #Question
	- DONE in [[VSCode/Dev Container]], my normal [[VSCode/Extension/QuickStage]] is not available; how do I install?  I see "This extension is disabled in this workspace because it is defined to run in the Remote Extension Host. Please install the extension in 'Dev Container @ desktop-linux' to enable. [Learn More](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Cursor.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)"
		- Learn more links to [[VSCode/Docs/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions]]
		- I had to "pop out" to the version of the repository that was NOT in a dev container, then put the vscode extension identifier `bs-code.git-quick-stage` in; then I had to rebuild it.
