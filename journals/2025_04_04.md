		- [[tldr]] `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` allow large language models (LLMs) and agents to access programming documentation and APIs, particularly useful within integrated development environments (IDEs). As of [[2025-03-09 Sun]], IDEs [do not yet have robust native support for llms.txt](https://x.com/jeremyphoward/status/1902109312216129905?t=1eHFv2vdNdAckajnug0_Vw&s=19), **but** langchain has an [[MCP Server]] for accessing these files, and they happen to provide them for the langchain ecosystem.
