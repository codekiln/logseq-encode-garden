# [[MCP]] Troubleshooting
	- I tried to get [[CursorAI]] [[MCP]] for [[Atlassian/MCP]] to work in both [[CursorAI/CLI]] and regular desktop, and at first, I just could not today.
		- In the desktop version, the authenticate button didn't do anything (it would not open up a browser like it normally did to complete the OAuth flow).
		- In the CLI version, authenticate worked, but the tools timed out.
	- Atlassian MCP previously worked for me in the desktop version (but not the CLI version, where there was some bug that prevented authentication if I was authenticated in desktop).
	- Eventually, I had the hypothesis that using the same MCP server in both the desktop and CLI versions of cursor was causing a bug, so I tried quitting cursor desktop and only using the MCP from Cursor CLI, and then it worked!
