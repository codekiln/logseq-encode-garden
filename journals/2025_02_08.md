		- this is based on the assumption that you want to open up each repo individually
			- which isn't always the case
		- some comments say that [[git]] can't be used in this case
			- > But now you can't use git inside your devcontainer, which is a bit of a dealbreaker. 🙁 Any way to have the best of both worlds?
		- This is a part of [[YouTube/@code/Playlist/Getting Started with Dev Containers]]

			- ## Monorepos in a Dev Container
				- The configuration sets up a Dev Container for working with a monorepo in VSCode.
				- **Key settings:**
					- `"remoteUser": "node"` → Runs the container as the `node` user instead of `root`.
					- `"workspaceMount": "source=${localWorkspaceFolder},target=/workspace,type=bind"` → Binds the local workspace folder to `/workspace` inside the container.
					- `"workspaceFolder": "/workspace"` → Sets the workspace folder inside the container.
				- This setup ensures that:
					- The workspace is correctly mounted inside the container.
					- The correct user permissions are applied.
					- It supports working with multiple repositories in a shared development environment.
