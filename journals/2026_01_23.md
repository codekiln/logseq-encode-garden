- [[git/worktree]]
	- learned that `git worktree list` works just fine when in a worktree that's a sibling of the original repo. perhaps that should have been obvious but it wasn't to me
- beware new startups.
	- self-reliance is key.

- [[Keyshort]] mastery
	- [[GitHub/Desktop]]
		- `cmd+t` - quickly search for repositories
		- ctrl+backtick - open in configured terminal emulator
- [[iTerm2]]
	- background color is determined by "Profile > Colors" not by "Appearance > Colors"
	- [[iTerm2/Setting/Profiles/Colors/Minimum Contrast]] really helps with AI coding tools that like to be all subtle. LOL

	- [[AI tooling]] Permission fatigue for CLI access for AI coding tools
		- Pain: per-repo / per-directory repeats “allow this command?” prompts across agents
		- Example configs / docs
			- Claude Code hierarchical settings: `~/.claude/settings.json` (user-wide) and `.claude/settings.json` (project)
			- Claude Code best practices mention `/permissions` + allowlisting patterns (e.g., `Bash(git commit:*)`)
			- Cursor Agent “Terminal Command Allowlist” docs
			- RuleSync (unified rules/commands/MCP configs across tools, but not a shared permissions broker)
		- Security reality check
			- Cursor: allowlist is “best-effort” / not a real security boundary
			- Cursor advisory: allowlist bypass via env vars in some cases
		- Likely best workaround today: sandboxing (devcontainer/container) + scoped tokens instead of global host permissions
