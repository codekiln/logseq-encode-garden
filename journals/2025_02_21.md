		- How to set up an [[AWS/S3]] source for a knowledge base
			- [Ingest changes directly into a knowledge base - Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-direct-ingestion.html)
				- Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases also offers a set of `IngestionJob` API operations that relate to [syncing your data source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-data-source-sync-ingest.html). When you sync your data source with a [StartIngestionJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent_StartIngestionJob.html) request, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases scans each document in the connected data source and verifies whether it has already been indexed into the vector store set up for the knowledge base. If it hasn't, it becomes indexed into the vector store.
				- Add documents into your S3 location or delete documents from it. Then sync your data source in the AWS Management Console or submit a `StartIngestionJob` request in the API. For details about syncing and the `StartIngestionJob` operation, see [Sync your data with your Amazon Bedrock knowledge base](./kb-data-source-sync-ingest.html).
				- Ingest S3 documents into the knowledge base directly with an `IngestKnowledgeBaseDocuments` request. For details about directly ingesting documents, see [Ingest documents directly into a knowledge base](./kb-direct-ingestion-add.html).
