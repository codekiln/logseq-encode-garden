- ## Troubleshooting #Error between [[GitHub/CLI]] and the [[1Password/Dev/CLI/Shell Plugin/GitHub]] with [[Authentication/SSO]]
	- Came across a bit of a tricky issue where because I had accidentally cloned a [[git]] private repository with https instead of ssh. In addition, I had the `op` 1Password CLI set up with a [[GitHub Fine-Grained PAT]] for using the `gh` CLI tool. When I went to do [[git/push]], it requested auth via SSO, and when I tried to do `gh auth login`, it wouldn't let me, because `op` was injecting [[GitHub/CLI/EnvVar/GITHUB_TOKEN]], but for the wrong token! It complained about needing to unset `GITHUB_TOKEN`, but I didn't remember having even set that; I hadn't fully known that the `op` shell plugin was setting that. The key was to update the origin on the git repo to use [[ssh]] instead of `https`, then it used my SSH key permissions for push instead of HTTPS. Not ergonomic!
