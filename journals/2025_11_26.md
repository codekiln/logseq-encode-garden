	- [Access Amazon Bedrock foundation models - Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html#model-access-permissions)
		- > To modify access to Amazon Bedrock foundation models, you first need to attach an identity-based IAM policy with the following [AWS Marketplace actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsmarketplace.html#awsmarketplace-actions-as-permissions) to the IAM role that allows access to Amazon Bedrock.
		- > **When you first invoke an Amazon Bedrock serverless model** served from AWS Marketplace in an account, **Bedrock attempts to automatically enable the model for your account**. **For this auto-enablement to work, AWS Marketplace permissions are required**.
		- > If **you can't assume AWS Marketplace permission**, someone with AWS Marketplace permissions **must enable the model for the account as a one-time step (either manually or via auto-enablement)**. Once enabled, **all users in the account can invoke the model without needing AWS Marketplace permissions**. Users don't need AWS Marketplace subscription permissions to invoke models after they've been enabled. These permissions are only required the first time a model is being used in an account.
