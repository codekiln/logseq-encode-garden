- #Work
	- work log for [[c74/M4L/Idea/Alits]] in [[Person/codekiln/GitHub/alits]]
	- A bit more work on learning [[VSCode/Dev Container]]s
		- [[GitHub/codekiln/dev-container-test]]
			- [[VSCode/Docs/remote/faq/Can I run VSCode Server on Older Linux Distributions]]
			  collapsed:: true
				- When it started up, I saw this warning: `[10160 ms] !!! WARNING: Using legacy server, please check https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/faq/old-linux for additional information !!!`
					- That link now redirects to the docs page linked above, which says,
						- > Starting with VS Code release 1.86.1 (January 2024), the minimum requirements for the build toolchain of the remote server were raised. **The prebuilt servers distributed by VS Code are compatible with Linux distributions based on [[glibc]] 2.28 or later**, for example, Debian 10, RHEL 8, or Ubuntu 20.04. VS Code will still allow users to connect to an OS that is not supported by VS Code (OS that does not provide glibc >= 2.28 and libstdc++ >= 3.4.25) **until February 2025**
				- I saw [[GitHub/microsoft/vscode/issues/204269 Disappointment with Latest VSCode Update]]
				- I also saw [[StackOverflow/VSCode server unexpected Missing GLIBC gt eq 2.28]]
				- #Observation for now, [[VSCode/Dev Container]] working, but it makes me wonder if it will soon break by the end of the month
					- DONE #Q what version of [[glibc]] is available on [[Mac/OS]]?
						- Ans: I think it has nothing to do with macOS per se, it's about the image that you use, and I'm using `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/typescript-node:1-22-bookworm`

				- Upon logging in this morning, I made a commit with the current dev container setup
				- [[Dev Container/Issue/Extension Not Found]]
					- result: filed [Dev Containers not installing valid VS Code Extension - Minimal Reproduction - Bug Report - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/dev-containers-not-installing-valid-vs-code-extension-minimal-reproduction/49294) [[Bug/Report]]
- #Learned

	- [[c74/max/obj/node.script/Ref/Node for Max]]
		- Apparently, it  is possible to create a node.script Node for Max object and then bundle it in an [[c74/M4L/.amxd]], but the docs on how to do that are centered on [[c74/max/standalone]] installations, not [[c74/M4L]].
		- the key insight is that all js files in the context of [[c74/js]] **must have unique file names**
