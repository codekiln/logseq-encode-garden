- [[Langstar]] work
	- Added a comment to a [[DevContainer]] issue on  [here](https://github.com/codekiln/langstar/issues/718#issuecomment-3772653235) with a projected workaround for the difference between [[JetBrains/RustRover]] and other devcontainer environments. It's possible that [[JetBrains/DevContainer/ijdevc]] could help with this, but that requires a bit more research.
		- Did some [[AI Deep Research]] with [[ChatGPT]] [here](https://chatgpt.com/c/696f7610-2e50-832e-81d8-faab0de29201?ref=mini).
