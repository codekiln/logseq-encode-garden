- [[Repomix/How To/Have AI create repomix configuration bundles for topics]]
	- This morning I used a new technique - I used an [[AI/Coding/Tool]] to update the `bundles.json` based on a query in the repo, e.g.
		- >  configuration called aws-okta-login and put files in it that are related to whether I could replace my usage of `aws_okta_keyman` with `aws sso login`.
	- This ended up adding the following to my `bundles.json` for repomix, which I then generated and used in [[ChatGPT]]. This was cool because I essentially used [[CursorAI]]'s vector indexing to quickly integrate with a chatgpt deep research query.
		- ```json

- [[Claude Code]]
	- [[Anthropic/App/Claude Code/Bedrock]]
		- Learned
			- the `awsAuthRefresh` claude code configuration key, which could help with [[AWS/Bedrock]] timeouts, which are annoying
			- [[AWS/CLI/sso/login]] `aws sso login --profile=<your-profile-name>` can be used to login to [[AWS]] with [[SSO]]. Started some [[Requirement/Elicitation]] with [[ChatGPT]] [here](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-689b98419e0c8191afc93b5d420e904c-bmad/c/68ea3830-b3e0-8328-b712-a4f47fc3655b)

	- [[Open Source]] competitor [[DeepWiki/Open]] - [AsyncFuncAI/deepwiki-open: Open Source DeepWiki: AI-Powered Wiki Generator for GitHub/Gitlab/Bitbucket Repositories.](https://github.com/AsyncFuncAI/deepwiki-open)
	- [[DeepWiki/MCP]] requires [[Devin]] account.
		- I thought devin was a LOT more expensive ... but apparently it starts at $20 / month, goes to $500/month for teams, which is relatively comparable to [[CursorAI]]
