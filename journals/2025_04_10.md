				- Today I Learned about the use of **FastAPI Background Tasks**, a really handy tool for offloading work from your main request-response cycle. If you're dealing with tasks like sending emails, updating records, or any operations that don't need to delay your response, Background Tasks seem like a convenient abstraction over asyncio primitives in a FastAPI context.
