		- [The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking: Self-Reported Reductions in Cognitive Effort and Confidence Effects From a Survey of Knowledge Workers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3706598.3713778)
			- #Abstract
				- > The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) in knowledge workflows raisesquestions about its impact on critical thinking skills and practices.We survey 319 knowledge workers to investigate 1) when andhow they perceive the enaction of critical thinking when usingGenAI, and 2) when and why GenAI affects their effort to do so.Participants shared 936 first-hand examples of using GenAI in worktasks. Quantitatively, when considering both task- and user-specificfactors, a user’s task-specific self-confidence and confidence inGenAI are predictive of whether critical thinking is enacted andthe effort of doing so in GenAI-assisted tasks. Specifically, higherconfidence in GenAI is associated with less critical thinking, whilehigher self-confidence is associated with more critical thinking.Qualitatively, GenAI shifts the nature of critical thinking towardinformation verification, response integration, and task stewardship.Our insights reveal new design challenges and opportunities fordeveloping GenAI tools for knowledge work.
