		- Today I had a thought that it's a shame that most of the [[AI Coding]] tools that are out there are oriented toward static tool registration. For example, you typically either add or do not add an MCP server to a [[Claude Code]] or [[CursorAI]], but there's no way to dynamically register an MCP server based on when a given problem has revealed that use of that MCP server is needed. As a result, AI coding tools tend to run with a lot more bloated context than they need.
	- [[rulesync]] claims to be a tool to enable syncing rules and other features across [[Claude Code]], [[CursorAI]], etc. - See [[rulesync/log/25/09/29 Mon - First time with rulesync]]
