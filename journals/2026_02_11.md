	- ## Key Takeaways
		- I love the idea of [[AI/Coding/Dark Factory]]: software engineers move up a level from typing code to designing specifications, scenario suites, and validation harnesses that coding agents execute repeatedly. The point is not "no quality bar" - it is replacing manual code review with stronger system-level evidence (holdout scenarios, probabilistic satisfaction metrics, and massive automated scenario throughput).
		- Another awesome post from Simon at https://github.com/simonw/research illustrating how fast the world is moving, plus two new CLIs he put out: `showboat` for agents to demo AI coding work and `rodney` for agents to connect to Chrome DevTools.
		- Observation on MCP auth reliability: in my experience, MCP is flakier for authentication across specific clients than using direct command-line tools with API keys. With Atlassian MCP, Cursor CLI and Cursor Desktop both seem buggy around auth state; authenticating one can break the other, and if Cursor Desktop is open it can even break Atlassian MCP auth in Cursor CLI. I've also seen OAuth handshake/session-sharing issues across other AI coding agents, where sessions are not reliably shared. MCP is often described as a solution to auth fragmentation, but in practice I keep hitting auth instability, while API keys work reliably every time across my agents.
		- Love the point:
			- > Daniel draws the analogy to "refinancing your codebase mortgage at a lower rate"
		- At the same time that I agree with [[Person/Dan Shapiro]] in this blog post, it's tough for me to know how to put aside [[Person/Steve Yegge]]'s recent comments, who literally wrote a book titled [[Vibe Coding]], and said here https://youtu.be/s96O9oWI_tI?si=Zrp6Hlx6wCywL_IW something I've felt in this last year: it's just as hard as regular coding; you're wrestling with it all day long and it uses gaslighting and deception to fool you into thinking it's at 100% when it's actually only at 60-80%, at least unless and until you put in layers and layers of custom verification, alignment, and cleanup processes. As he points out there:
			- > 17:47 "It's just fundamentally easier to find something wrong with something than is to build it in the first place."
		- This is actually why I'm comfortable with still using [[Logseq]] even though the product is headed in the direction of sqlite rather than markdown - I'm banking on the idea that by the time the old markdown-files-based version I plan to keep using is removed, AI coding tools will be far enough along that the cost of forking and fixing will be negligible.
	- ## Agent Ops
		- Inspired by [[Person/Greg Brockman]]'s recent post:
			- > by March 31st, we're aiming that: For any technical task, the tool of first resort for humans is interacting with an agent rather than using an editor or terminal.
		- I want to see how much I can do by the end of quarter by defining specific agents (for me these are AI coding tool prompts) that do specific tasks.
		- In addition to coding agents, I now have operational agents/prompts that:
			- make meeting-notes pages in Confluence for weekly meetings using templates
			- find and import Jira tickets into my local system for tracking and work notes
			- manage release and deploy drudgery for AI services (mostly Git and Jira operations)
			- help onboard new users into a specific system we use
			- start the day by updating the tools I depend on
			- log technical questions and kick off a research process to answer them
			- fetch meeting transcripts, summarize them, and place summaries in meeting notes
			- review the week and generate a personal end-of-week summary in notes
			- create and update agents (implemented as a Claude Code rule that can find/create/update a rule file for a specific job)
			- push updates to Confluence after drawing on source data
