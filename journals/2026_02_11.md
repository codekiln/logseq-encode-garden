## [[AI/Coding]]
	- Imported [[Person/Simon Willison/Blog/26/02/How StrongDM's AI team build serious software without even looking at the code]] from Readwise and captured highlights.
	- I love the idea of [[AI/Coding/Dark Factory]]: software engineers move up a level from typing code to designing specifications, scenario suites, and validation harnesses that coding agents execute repeatedly. The point is not "no quality bar"—it is replacing manual code review with stronger system-level evidence (holdout scenarios, probabilistic satisfaction metrics, and massive automated scenario throughput).

		- Added entity and GitHub sub-namespace references:
			- [[StrongDM/GitHub/attractor]]
			- [[StrongDM/GitHub/cxdb]]
- Added [[Person/Armin Ronacher/Blog/26/02/A Language For Agents]] with imported Readwise annotations from Armin’s post.
- Updated [[Person/Armin Ronacher]] to link the new blog page under person links.
- Learned the trick for entering a backtick (`) on iOS: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1808/is-there-a-backquote-on-the-iphone-keyboard
- Imported [[Person/Simon Willison/Blog/26/02/Introducing Showboat and Rodney, so agents can demo what they've built]] from Readwise and added notes.
	- Another awesome post from Simon at https://github.com/simonw/research illustrating how fast the word is moving as well as two new CLIs he just put out, `showboat` for agents to give demos of AI coding and `rodney` for agents to connect to chrome devtools.
- Added [[Person/Dan Shapiro]].
- Imported [[Person/Dan Shapiro/Blog/25/12/This Is a Time of Technical Deflation]] from Readwise and added observations.
	- Love the point:
		- > Daniel draws the analogy to “refinancing your codebase mortgage at a lower rate”
	- At the same time that I agree with [[Person/Dan Shapiro]] in this blog post, it's tough for me to know how to put aside [[Person/Steve Yegge]]’s recent comments, who literally wrote a book titled [[Vibe Coding]], who said here https://youtu.be/s96O9oWI_tI?si=Zrp6Hlx6wCywL_IW something I've felt in this last year: it's just as hard as regular coding; you're wrestling with it all day long and it uses gaslighting and deception to fool you into thinking it's at 100% when it's actually only at 60-80%, at least, unless until you put in layers and layers of custom verification, alignment, clean up processes, etc. but as he points out there:
		- > 17:47 "It's just fundamentally easier to find something wrong with something than is to build it in the first place."
	- This is actually why I'm comfortable with stil using [[Logseq]] even though the product is headed in the direction of sqlite rather than markdown - I'm banking on the idea that by the time the old version that is "markdown-files based" that I plan to keep using is removed, AI coding tools will be far enough along that the cost of forking and fixing will be negligible.
- Imported [[Person/Steve Yegge/Book/25/Vibe Coding]] and linked it from [[Person/Steve Yegge]] and [[Person/Gene Kim]].
