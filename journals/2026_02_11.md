	- ## Key Takeaways
		- I love the idea of [[AI/Coding/Dark Factory]]: software engineers move up a level from typing code to designing specifications, scenario suites, and validation harnesses that coding agents execute repeatedly. The point is not "no quality bar" - it is replacing manual code review with stronger system-level evidence (holdout scenarios, probabilistic satisfaction metrics, and massive automated scenario throughput).
		- Another awesome post from Simon at https://github.com/simonw/research illustrating how fast the world is moving, plus two new CLIs he put out: `showboat` for agents to demo AI coding work and `rodney` for agents to connect to Chrome DevTools.
		- Love the point:
			- > Daniel draws the analogy to "refinancing your codebase mortgage at a lower rate"
		- At the same time that I agree with [[Person/Dan Shapiro]] in this blog post, it's tough for me to know how to put aside [[Person/Steve Yegge]]'s recent comments, who literally wrote a book titled [[Vibe Coding]], and said here https://youtu.be/s96O9oWI_tI?si=Zrp6Hlx6wCywL_IW something I've felt in this last year: it's just as hard as regular coding; you're wrestling with it all day long and it uses gaslighting and deception to fool you into thinking it's at 100% when it's actually only at 60-80%, at least unless and until you put in layers and layers of custom verification, alignment, and cleanup processes. As he points out there:
			- > 17:47 "It's just fundamentally easier to find something wrong with something than is to build it in the first place."
		- This is actually why I'm comfortable with still using [[Logseq]] even though the product is headed in the direction of sqlite rather than markdown - I'm banking on the idea that by the time the old markdown-files-based version I plan to keep using is removed, AI coding tools will be far enough along that the cost of forking and fixing will be negligible.
