- ## [[AI/Coding]]
	- Imported [[Person/Simon Willison/Blog/26/02/How StrongDM's AI team build serious software without even looking at the code]] from Readwise and captured highlights.
	- I love the idea of [[AI/Coding/Dark Factory]]: software engineers move up a level from typing code to designing specifications, scenario suites, and validation harnesses that coding agents execute repeatedly. The point is not "no quality bar"—it is replacing manual code review with stronger system-level evidence (holdout scenarios, probabilistic satisfaction metrics, and massive automated scenario throughput).
