## The [[AI/Engineer]] Mindset
	- [[Tip]]
		- I think there's a good chance that a strong component of why AI-assisted software engineering is the most effective application of LLMs is because software engineers have already deeply internalized the "inputs -> outputs" mentality, and instinctively don't think there's a "someone else" that's responsible for changing the behavior of the system. It's always the inputs that determine the outputs.
		- If you find yourself complaining about interactions with LLMs starting with the words "The AI XYZ ...," consider instead starting with the words "The way I'm prompting this, I'm noticing XYZ..." This helps mindset shift helps us see better see how to achieve our aims with LLMs.
		- There's a comparison here to relationships with other humans. If you say to another human, "you make me feel angry," that divests you of agency. If you say to another human, "when you do/say XYZ, then I often find that afterward I am feeling ABC," it opens up the discussion from a point of curiosity.
