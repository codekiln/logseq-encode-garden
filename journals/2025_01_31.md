			- > I was looking for the same thing and was bout to build a pipeline for PR review, but that is actually not necessary. In Cursor Chat, you can use @PR to reference it and add some instructions that serve your needs.
			  Here’s how I do it:
				- ```
				  @PR (Diff with Main Branch) 
				  Please analyze the code changes and provide the following information:
				  
				  1. **Intent and Purpose**: Summarize the goal of the changes. Explain what functionality or behavior the changes aim to introduce, modify, or fix.
				  
				  2. **Potential Issues**: Identify any possible problems the changes might introduce, such as:
				     - Bugs or unintended side effects.
				     - Performance concerns.
				     - Code quality issues (e.g., readability, maintainability, scalability).
				     - Violations of best practices or standards.
				  
				  3. **Suggestions for Improvement**: Recommend any improvements or alternative approaches that could enhance the code.
				  ```

			- Use Cases
				- comment by jvnk
					- > In the course of your prompting, you could ask for things like "look up the docs for ....", "query this sqlite db for...", "create this table..." so on and so forth. The sky is the limit really.
					- > The LLM should figure out it wants to call a tool, and format a response appropriately. Cursor(I believe) is providing the model a system prompt so it understands how to do this. The response is handed back to the LLM and then it decides how to present it to you, but the actual interactions should also be visible.
					- > For me, I can ask it to look at files I don't have open in Cursor using the `filesystem` server, or query the perplexity API to search the web for updated docs info using mcp-perplexity, etc etc.
				- comment by femio
					- > Kind of? The context length doesn't change but Cursor can more easily check files on your computer even if it's out of context.
					- > Just think of MCP servers as a library of tools that you can install. Cursor comes with tools for say, running CLI commands built in. You just have access to a collection of pre-built ones.
				- comment by badasimo
					- > It also has a security benefit. Cursor can already interact with things sort of... raw. You can let it SSH into a remote server for instance or run commands on your computer. An MCP will have a defined set of things it can and can't do and interact with and have it formatted better for interacting with an LLM.
					- > For instance many command line tools have styling and decoration, interactive features etc that an LLM doesn't need, it just needs output. Lately agent has struggled with things like that.
					- > I believe that we will have other agents/models inside MCPs doing their own special things. For instance operating browsers and things like that.

	- ### Description
		- Formatting markdown output
	- ### Globs
		- `*.md`
	- ### Rule
		- **# Be careful when nesting markdown fenced code blocks**
		- Wrap the beginning and end of your answer in backticks.
		- If there are code snippets, do not wrap the beginning and end of your answers inside backticks. Instead, wrap the code snippet in a fenced code blocks that is delimited with three tilde characters.
