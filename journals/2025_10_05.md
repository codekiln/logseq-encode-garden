- [[Typescript/Concept/Barrel File]] - as with [[Py/init.py]] files, I prefer if developers don't try to use them to hide details or reshape the import structure. Updated [[My/Dev/Tool/Pref/Typescript]] accordingly.

- [[poml]] - created Diataxis conceptual overview for Microsoft's Prompt Orchestration Markup Language, discovered through [[GitHub/dyoshikawa/rulesync]] issue [#136](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/issues/136) where [[Person/Kazuki Yamada]] suggested POML for DRYing out prompt fragments with includes and substitutions. My main comment upon looking at it is, "why would anybody use this instead of [[Jinja]]?" The main drawback of these [[DSL]]s is that they tend to make [[SMEs]] uncomfortable. This doesn't even attempt to fix that, in my opinion; it's still going to be just as confusing or even more confusing than XML or plain Markdown. But one thing that's intriguing about it is the idea that it's a simple coding framework designed for the things needed in [[Prompt Template]]s that doesn't require a too much of programming language harness (e.g. jinja really only makes sense in a python project).
