- [[Typescript/Concept/Barrel File]] - as with [[Py/init.py]] files, I prefer if developers don't try to use them to hide details or reshape the import structure. Updated [[My/Dev/Tool/Pref/Typescript]] accordingly.

- [[poml]] - created Diataxis conceptual overview for Microsoft's Prompt Orchestration Markup Language, discovered through [[GitHub/dyoshikawa/rulesync]] issue [#136](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/issues/136) where [[Person/Kazuki Yamada]] suggested POML for DRYing out prompt fragments with includes and substitutions. My main comment upon looking at it is, "why would anybody use this instead of [[Jinja]]?" The main drawback of these [[DSL]]s is that they tend to make [[SMEs]] uncomfortable. This doesn't even attempt to fix that, in my opinion; it's still going to be just as confusing or even more confusing than XML or plain Markdown. But one thing that's intriguing about it is the idea that it's a simple coding framework designed for the things needed in [[Prompt Template]]s that doesn't require a too much of programming language harness (e.g. jinja really only makes sense in a python project).

- [[BiomeJS]] - created Diataxis conceptual overview for this [[Rust/Library]] web development toolchain that unifies formatting, linting, and code analysis. Discovered through [[GitHub/dyoshikawa/rulesync]]'s use of it in their [biome.json](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/blob/main/biome.json) and [devcontainer configuration](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json#L16). BiomeJS aims to replace ESLint and [[Prettier]] with a single, faster tool (35x faster than Prettier) built in Rust.
- [[archive.ph]] - created page for this web archiving service that bypasses paywalls and login walls, particularly useful for accessing [[Medium]] articles without login requirements
