- ## Documentation
	- It seems like [[uv]]'s documentation page is using the word **Guides** to be either [[Diataxis/Tutorial]] or [[Diataxis/How To]] or the union of the two. I like this word. I have a feeling that they are using it to refer to How To guides, because [How-to guides - Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/) actually uses the word "guide" and also because the articles don't seem to adhere to the stle of [Tutorials - Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/).
