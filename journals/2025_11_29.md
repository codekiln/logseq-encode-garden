## Rust Study
	- ### [[Rust/Book/TRPL/Interactive]]
		- [[Rust/Variable/Type/Compound/Array]]
		- [[Rust/Expression]] vs [[Rust/Statement]] is more of a thing than I thought it would be.
		- Turns out [[Rust/Variable/let]] doesn't require initialization.
		- [[Rust/loop]] can have a [[Rust/break]] keyword that takes a parameter - the item to return. Example:
			- ```rust
			  fn main() {
			      let mut counter = 0;
			  
			      let result = loop {
			          counter += 1;
			  
			          if counter == 10 {
			              break counter * 2;
			          }
			      };
			  
			      println!("The result is {result}");
			  }
			  ```
	- Created [[Programming/Operator]] page with general information about operators in programming
	- Created [[Rust/Operator]] page (aliased as [[Rust Operators]]) with detailed information from [Appendix B: Operators and Symbols - The Rust Programming Language](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/appendix-02-operators.html)
		- Includes all Rust operators, their overloadability status, and associated traits
	- Released [[Person/codekiln/GitHub/langstar/v0.10.0]] with [[Structured Output]] and evals support.
