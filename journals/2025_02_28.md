		- ### 07:20 AI Development Phases and the Coding Engine
			- Codified my AI development phases and stages this morning.
			- Might be more in-depth than necessary, but eager to try it.
			- Feels like building an engine—a coding engine. [[Software/Engineering]] is now the act of building and tuning a specific coding engine, tailored to a specific domain or problem.
				- The engine consists of prompts meant to be invoked at specific phases in the software development lifecycle.
				- If done well, it could function like a checklist.
					- This could increase quality and consistency. [[Book/The Checklist Manifesto]].
		- ### 07:25 Traversal and Resolution in Learning
			- Driving everywhere limits the ability to notice details in the landscape.
			- Slower traversal increases resolution of time, life, and awareness.
			- Agentic coding feels like driving—accelerated but less granular.
			- Right before motor cars became widespread, people walked and biked more.
			- After cars, personal exploration of the landscape diminished.
			- Coding is approaching a similar shift, where implementation is rapid but potentially less thoughtful.
		- ### 07:30 The Balance Between Agentic and Classical Coding
			- Implementing something from scratch yields a more detailed mental map.
			- There’s an ideal mix or #Balance between agentic and classical coding.
			- Classical coding fosters struggle, which often leads to better abstractions and simplifications.
			- Without this struggle or the signal of felt pain, one may not recognize patterns that lead to cleaner designs.
			- #Q What percent of coding should be agentic versus personal?
