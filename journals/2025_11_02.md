## Technical Curiosity
	- A bit more on [[Nix/Package/Manager]]
		- [[YouTube/Fireship/Nix in 100 Seconds]]
		- [Best Way To Manage Project Dependencies | Nix Shells - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YBWhSNTgV8)
- ## Technical Techniques
	- [[git/submodule]]
		- took a few good notes in [[YouTube/@philomatics/25/05/Why everyone hates git submodules]]
			- [[YouTube/@philomatics]] runs git #Training classes for teams; he has quite a few videos on #git
- ## On #[[Good Design]] and #PKM
	- Took another look at [[Person/Maggie Appleton/Garden]] and appreciated the little details (yet again)
		- came across [[Person/Maggie Appleton/Essay/25/ai-enlightenment]]; love the "Assumed Audience" callout at the top
		- She has an "Antilibrary" for books she hasn't read yet. Neat framing. I could use this!
			- {{embed [[Person/Maggie Appleton/Garden/Antilibrary]]}}
				- Some really cool books in here.
		- [[Person/Maggie Appleton/Talk/24/05/Home-Cooked Software and Barefoot Developers]]
			- Updated [[Dev/Barefoot]] with definition Maggie's talk on home-cooked software and barefoot developers
			- Created person page for [[Person/Clay Shirky]] - writer, technologist, and educator who first proposed the concept of [[Software/Situated]] in 2004, and filled out that page as well
- ## Reviewing Recent Podcasts
	- Earlier this week, I listened to [[Person/Gergely Orosz/Podcast/25/10/Beyond Vibe Coding with Addy Osmani]], which was probably the 2nd time I listened to his podcast, The Pragmatic Engineer. The first time I listened to it was [[Person/Gergely Orosz/Podcast/25/10/Python Go Rust Typescript AI Armin Ronacher]]
		- Created [[Programming/Language/Feature/Context/Local]] page with definition of context locals (storage that flows with logical execution flow, essential for async/await and promise chains)
