					- [[Person/Gwern Branwen]] github.com/gwern [[GitHub/gwern]] [Gwern's site](https://www.gwern.net/index): The way he presents content is unique and gorgeous. I've found myself not very hooked to the content, but when you find something you like it's awesome, such as the [about page](https://www.gwern.net/About), his article on [spaced repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition) or the essay of [Death Note: L, Anonymity & Eluding Entropy](https://www.gwern.net/Death-Note-Anonymity).
