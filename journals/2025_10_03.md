	- [Developing Talent in Young People by Benjamin S. Bloom | Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1471204.Developing_Talent_in_Young_People) #Book
	- question - if everyone got an `A` by rule, would that have a positive, negative or neutral effect on engagement?
	- it would be cool to document all the "co-curriculars" and the "lesson plans" with respect to the goals of teachers there (examples: learning from other students, metalearning about note-taking, etc)
	- great point - [[Poll/Everywhere]] in the classroom produces engagement, but then people take their phone out and check their texts, which is then a source of #Distraction
- [[Book/Developing Talent in Young People]] by [[Person/Benjamin S. Bloom]]
