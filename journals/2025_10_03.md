- [[Spotify/How To/Go to song in playing playlist]] tl;dr - click on the now playing view at right's title link
- [[VSCode/Git/How To/Navigate Diff Changes Like JetBrains]] untested, but drafted at least. old issue for me!
- [[VSCode/YouTube/22/12/Extremely helpful guide to merge conflict]] was conceptually useful but didn't help me with my problem, which was that a 3-way merge in vscode that had zero conflicts didn't have a "done" or a "continue" button.
