# Journal Updates for Page Changes

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: When creating or modifying pages in the Logseq knowledge garden, you MUST always add an entry to today's journal to record the change.

## Guidelines

1. **For New Pages** (REQUIRED):
   - ⚠️ **MUST** add a journal entry with a link to the new page
   - Include a brief description of what the page contains
   - Example: `- [[New/Page/Name]] created to document specific concept or tool`
   - This step is mandatory - do not skip it

2. **For Updated Pages**:
   - Add a journal entry with a link to the updated page
   - Summarize what was added or changed
   - Example: `- Updated [[Existing/Page]] with new information on X topic`

3. **Format**:
   - Use bullet points (Logseq format)
   - Include page link using double square brackets: `[[Page/Name]]`
   - Keep descriptions concise but informative

4. **Journal Location**:
   - Add to the current day's journal file in `journals/YYYY_MM_DD.md`
   - Place new entries at an appropriate position in the journal file

This rule helps maintain a chronological record of knowledge garden evolution and makes it easier to track changes over time.
