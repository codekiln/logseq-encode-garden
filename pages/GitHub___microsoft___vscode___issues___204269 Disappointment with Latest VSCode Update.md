- [Disappointment with the Latest VSCode Update · Issue #204269 · microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/204269)
	- OP 1
		- Dear VSCode Team,
		- I am writing to let you know that I am deeply disappointed and frustrated with the latest update to Visual Studio Code. As a dedicated user, I have supported and advocated for VSCode, trusting that the development team values its user base and strives to maintain compatibility across updates.
		- It has come to my attention that the recent update has introduced significant compatibility issues, which have been disruptive to my work and, I believe, to the work of many others in the community. It is particularly disheartening to see that these issues were known yet seemingly disregarded in the decision to push forward with the release.
		- I am struggling to understand the rationale behind releasing an update that alienates loyal users, and I am concerned about the direction in which VSCode is heading. This situation has eroded my trust in the product and has left me questioning whether I can rely on VSCode for my future development needs.
		- I urge the VSCode team to consider the impact of such updates on its user community and to take immediate steps to address these concerns. It is crucial to remember that the success of VSCode is built on the support of its users, and it is those same users who are now feeling neglected.
		- I hope my message conveys the seriousness of the situation and prompts a re-evaluation of the update strategy. I look forward to a response that acknowledges these issues and outlines how they will be rectified.
		- Sincerely
	- OP 2
		- **Just for the new requirement of minimum [[glibc]] >= 2.28.**
		- This problem has had a significant negative impact on our productivity and workflow. It is crucial for our team to have a stable and reliable development environment, and unfortunately, the new version of VSCode does not meet our needs at this time.
		  Maybe we just not deserve new vscode version.
		  We and many other teams just can not upgrade glibc version for many reason, have you considered our feelings and future?
		  **Have you truly developed with the user, who have many non-technical consumers, in mind, or are you just a group of academicians?**
			- *what?*
	- ## Notes
		- apparently, there was a [[VSCode]] release in [[2024/01]] that completely broke development environments for many developers until they released a [recovery version](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/204269#issuecomment-1934518010) with a legacy server
			- > 1.86.1 has been released that includes the legacy server ([#204344](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/204344)) for older GLIBC versions
