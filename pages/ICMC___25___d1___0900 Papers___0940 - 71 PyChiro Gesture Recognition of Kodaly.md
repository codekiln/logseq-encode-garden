	- ## ðŸ§  What Is PyChiro?
		- **PyChiro** is a **real-time gesture recognition system** designed to bring the **KodÃ¡ly Chironomic Method** into digital music interaction. It supports music pedagogy, therapy, and performance by mapping hand gesturesâ€”captured via webcamâ€”to musical outputs using MIDI.
	- ### ðŸ”§ Key Features:
		- **Real-time webcam gesture capture**
		- **Neural network-based gesture classification**
		- **Direct MIDI output for feedback**
		- Open-source and platform-flexible
	- ### ðŸ“Œ Use Cases:
		- **Music education** (e.g., solfÃ¨ge practice with feedback)
		- **Therapeutic applications** (gesture-based interaction for accessibility)
		- **Live performance** (hands-only conducting of digital music)
		- **Creative composition** (gestural interfaces for DAWs)
	- ## ðŸ”¬ Technical Summary:
		- Gesture features are extracted via computer vision.
		- A trained deep learning model classifies gestures with high precision.
		- MIDI output is triggered to correspond to recognized gestures.
		- Built for portability and ease of setup using a standard webcam.
