# [Introducing Claude 4 in Amazon Bedrock, the most powerful models for coding from Anthropic | AWS News Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/claude-opus-4-anthropics-most-powerful-model-for-coding-is-now-in-amazon-bedrock/)
	- To see Opus 4 or Sonnet 4 in action, [enable the new model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html) in your AWS account. Then, you can start coding using the [Bedrock Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html) with model ID`anthropic.claude-opus-4-20250514-v1:0` for Opus 4 and `anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0` for Sonnet 4. We recommend using the Converse API, because it provides a consistent API that works with all Amazon Bedrock models that support messages. This means you can write code one time and use it with different models.
