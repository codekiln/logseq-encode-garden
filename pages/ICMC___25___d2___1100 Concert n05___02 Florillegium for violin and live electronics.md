		- Very #Cool
			- 11:20 the electronics are resampling violin, but they sound almost like [[Instrument/Melodica]]
			- 11:22 now it is almost like [[Instrument/Organ]] or [[Instrument/Reed]]. visuals are circles cmyk style or rgb
			- 11:25 a bit like [[Person/Steve Reich]] now - I like how hte circles give a "mental model" of the tracking
	- ## #Description
		- **Florilegium** – ==a collection of flowers==.
		- This piece explores some of my interests regarding combining a solo instrument with live computer interaction to create a slowly-evolving tapestry of sound.
		- The piece takes the idea of [[Music/Bariolage]] between violin strings as a starting point
		- uses ==both pitch-tracking and tempo detection== to recognize a ==series of predetermined motivic “cues”== to advance the live sound processing ==non-linearly through a series of “events”==
		- create a tight fusion of the live violin and its real-time transposed sound. The simple video projection is a direct visual representation of the parameters used to create of the transposed violin sounds, which use cyclic patterns of different lengths inspired by the ubiquitous isorhythmic techniques found in medieval music. This work was made possible through the generous support of Hanyang University’s Performance Exhibition Support Project (Grant No. 202400000001682).
