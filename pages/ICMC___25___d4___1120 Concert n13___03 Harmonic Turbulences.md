				- **Gaël Moriceau** is currently a master’s student in Music, specializing in composition and sound creation, at Université de Montréal (UdeM). With several years of experience in aerospace and mechanical engineering in France, the United Kingdom, and Canada, Gaël underwent a career transition in 2019, shifting towards sound design and electroacoustic composition. Having obtained a bachelor’s degree in digital music from UdeM in 2022, Gaël primarily explores the acousmatic genre in his compositions, aiming to immerse listeners in abstract and unknown sonic spaces. He employs both field recording and computer synthesis ([[c74/msp]], [[SuperCollider]]), as well as various spatialization techniques, to craft unique sound objects and textures. As an affiliate student at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music, Media, and Technology (CIRMMT), Gaël also collaborates with the Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL) at [[Uni/McGill]] University, focusing on the development of playing techniques for digital musical instruments (DMI), particularly the T-Stick.
