- # [P2997 - Enterprise Learner Record](https://sagroups.ieee.org/p2997/)
	- **Scope: **The proposed standard consists of two parts. The first part of the standard defines the **Enterprise Learner Record** (ELR) data model for the various data objects that are used in the standard. The ELR data model preserves data ownership and integrity by providing indications to where raw learner data is stored and by providing the ability to track:
		- the learner’s path through different organizations
		- the variety of learning experiences – demonstrated competencies
		- conferred credentials
		- employment history The data model describes the different ELR data elements and allows the expression of rules for how schema elements are populated and how this data is stored within a Learner Profile for auditing purposes within an organization.
	- The second part of the standard defines the transfer methods and application programming interface (API) for communicating learner records between services that adhere to the specification. This includes the format of requests and the expected responses. The Learner API enables privacy and security of learner data as it is transmitted between connected systems through formal information exchange agreements (e.g., Interservice Connection Agreement). The Learner API follows the guidelines of the Representational State Transfer (REST) software architecture style and is transferred via HTTP requests and responses.
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- It doesn't look like this ever made it to a standard, but there was a project [[US/Gov/ADL/ELRR]]
