	- ## #Description
		- The FLAPIBox (FLexible instrument Augmentation that is Programmable, Integrated in a Box) is an innovative, flexible, cross-instrumental augmentation device that is adaptable to a wide range of instruments, utilizing di-verse loudspeaker and microphone technologies without necessitating permanent modifications to the instruments themselves. The aim of the development is to design a system to seamlessly integrate electronic sound with acoustic instruments and the first compositions utilizing it has already been written. The FLAPIBox combines concepts form both augmented (hyper-) instruments and self-resonating vibrotactile feedback instruments (SRIs) to enhance musical expression and performance.
		- This paper reports recent evolution and presents the latest version of the FLAPIBox. After three years of development, several iterations and meticulous bench tests of various components, the latest version appears both stable and well-worked. The paper also discusses the critical considerations that have shaped the physical and technical design of the FLAPIBox and proposes directions for future development.
