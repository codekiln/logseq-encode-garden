	- PARA is based on a simple observation: that there are only four categories that encompass all the information in your life.

	- You have **projects** you’re actively working on – short-term efforts (in your work or personal life) that you take on with a certain goal in mind. For example:
		- Complete webpage design
		- Buy a new computer
		- Write research report
		- Renovate the bathroom
		- Finish Spanish language course
		- Set up new living room furniture
	- You have **areas** of responsibility – important parts of your work and life that require ongoing attention. These might include:
		- Work responsibilities such as Marketing, Human Resources, Product Management, Research and Development, Direct Reports, or Engineering
		- Personal responsibilities such as Health, Finances, Kids, Writing, Car, or Home
	- Then you have **resources** on a range of topics you’re interested in and learning about, such as:
		- Graphic design
		- Personal productivity
		- Organic gardening
		- Coffee
		- Modern architecture
		- Web design
		- Japanese language
		- French literature
		- Notetaking
		- Breathwork
		- Habit formation
		- Photography
		- Marketing assets
	- Finally, you have **archives**, which include anything from the previous three categories that is no longer active, but you might want to save for future reference:
		- Projects you’ve completed or put on hold
		- Areas that are no longer active or relevant
		- Resources that you’re no longer interested in
