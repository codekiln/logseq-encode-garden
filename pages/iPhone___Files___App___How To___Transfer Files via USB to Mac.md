- # How to Transfer Files from [[iPhone]] [[Files App]] to [[Mac]] via [[USB]]
	- ## Goal
		- Transfer files stored in the iPhone Files app to a Mac computer using a USB cable connection
	- ## Preconditions
		- iPhone with iOS 11 or later
		- Mac computer (macOS Catalina or later uses Finder; earlier versions use iTunes)
		- USB cable (Lightning-to-USB or USB-C, depending on your iPhone model)
		- Files app installed (built-in)
	- ## Important Limitations
		- **File Location Matters**: Files stored in "On My iPhone" are app-specific and only accessible if the app supports file sharing
		- **iCloud Drive Files**: Files in iCloud Drive sync automatically and don't require USB transfer
		- **App Support Required**: Only apps that support file sharing will appear in Finder
	- ## Procedure
		- ### Method 1: Using Finder File Sharing (macOS Catalina and later)
			- **Connect Your iPhone:**
				- Use a USB cable to connect your iPhone to your Mac
				- Unlock your iPhone
				- If prompted, tap "Trust This Computer" and enter your iPhone passcode
			- **Open Finder:**
				- Open Finder on your Mac
				- In the Finder sidebar, look for your iPhone under "Locations"
				- Click on your iPhone to select it
			- **Access File Sharing:**
				- Click on the "Files" tab in the main Finder window
				- You'll see a list of apps that support file sharing
				- Select the app that contains the files you want to transfer
			- **Transfer Files:**
				- To copy files to your Mac: Drag and drop files from the app's list to a folder on your Mac
				- To add files from your Mac to your iPhone: Drag and drop files from your Mac into the app's list in Finder
		- ### Method 2: Using iCloud Drive (Recommended for Most Files)
			- **On iPhone:**
				- Open the Files app
				- Navigate to the file you want to transfer
				- Long-press the file and select "Move" or "Copy"
				- Navigate to iCloud Drive
				- Tap "Copy" or "Move" to place the file in iCloud Drive
			- **On Mac:**
				- Files in iCloud Drive will automatically sync to your Mac
				- Open Finder and navigate to iCloud Drive in the sidebar
				- Your files will be available there
			- **Note**: This method doesn't require USB, but files sync automatically when both devices are connected to the internet
		- ### Method 3: For Files in "On My iPhone" Location
			- **Identify the Source App:**
				- Files in "On My iPhone" are stored within specific apps
				- Check which app created or stores the file
			- **Check App File Sharing Support:**
				- Connect iPhone via USB and open Finder
				- Look for the app in the File Sharing section
				- If the app appears, you can transfer files using Method 1
				- If the app doesn't appear, it doesn't support file sharing via USB
	- ## Alternative Methods (When USB File Sharing Isn't Available)
		- **AirDrop:**
			- Open Files app on iPhone
			- Long-press the file and select "Share"
			- Choose "AirDrop" and select your Mac
			- Accept the transfer on your Mac
		- **Email or Cloud Services:**
			- Use the Share sheet in Files app
			- Send files to yourself via email or upload to cloud storage
		- **Third-Party Apps:**
			- Use apps like Documents by Readdle or FileBrowser that support more file transfer options
	- ## Troubleshooting
		- **iPhone doesn't appear in Finder:**
			- Ensure iPhone is unlocked and you've tapped "Trust This Computer"
			- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cable
			- Check that you're using a data-capable USB cable (not just charging cable)
		- **App doesn't appear in File Sharing:**
			- The app may not support file sharing
			- Try using iCloud Drive or AirDrop instead
		- **Files not syncing from iCloud Drive:**
			- Ensure both devices are signed into the same Apple ID
			- Check that iCloud Drive is enabled in Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud
			- Ensure both devices have internet connectivity
