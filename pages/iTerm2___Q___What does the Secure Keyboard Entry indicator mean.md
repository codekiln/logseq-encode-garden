- In [[iTerm2]], what does the indicator "Secure Keyboard Entry is enabled because another app has turned it on" mean?
	- ## Context
		- The iTerm2 indicator says: "Secure Keyboard Entry is enabled because another app has turned it on."
		- I want to understand what behavior changes when this is active, and whether I should disable it.
	- ## AI/Response
		- ### What it means
			- This indicates macOS Secure Keyboard Entry (Secure Input) is currently active at the OS level, and the app that enabled it was not the current iTerm2 session.
			- In practice: keystroke interception by other apps is blocked while it is active.
		- ### Why this exists
			- Per Apple Terminal docs, secure keyboard entry prevents other apps (or the network) from detecting what you type in terminal contexts.
			- iTerm2 also documents that Secure Keyboard Entry can block other programs from seeing typed input and may disable some global hotkeys.
		- ### Should I disable it?
			- If you are entering secrets (passwords, tokens), leaving it enabled is a reasonable security default.
			- If your workflow depends on global key listeners (autocomplete tools, text expanders, global hotkeys), disable it when needed.
			- If iTerm2 cannot uncheck Secure Keyboard Entry, another app likely enabled it and still holds it.
		- ### How to troubleshoot when another app enabled it
			- Check `iTerm2 > Secure Keyboard Entry` first.
			- If it cannot be unchecked, identify the owning process and restart/quit that app.
			- Useful command to identify owner process:
				- ~~~bash
				  ioreg -l -w 0 | tr ',' '\n' 2>/dev/null | grep kCGSSessionSecureInputPID | cut -f 2 -d = | uniq | xargs ps -o command= -p
				  ~~~
			- Common culprits reported in docs: terminal apps and sometimes password managers if they fail to release Secure Input.
