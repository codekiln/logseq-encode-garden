- # The Keys to Great Conversation
	- Harvard Business School professor [[Person/Alison Wood Brooks]] breaks down the science and art of conversation. Brooks is the author of the book [[Book/Talk]].
	- She introduces the **TALK** framework: **Topic**, **Asking**, **Levity**, and **Kindness**, aimed at improving conversational skills across all contexts—work, social, or personal.
	- Conversations are full of micro-decisions and are inherently uncertain; scripts and memorization don't work.

	- ## Topic
		- Every person brings unique goals into a conversation, so principles must be adaptable across contexts.

		- Choosing and switching topics is a major decision point in conversation:
			- Should we drift gently, switch abruptly, or end the exchange?
			- These choices steer the direction and outcome of the interaction.

		- **Topic prep**—spending 30 seconds to list potential topics—reduces anxiety and improves flow.
			- This works even for close relationships (e.g., calling your mom).

		- Even during conversations, **topic switching** can prevent lulls and keep things fresh.

	- ## Asking
		- Finding common ground is an essential service to others in group and one-on-one contexts.
			- Helps establish ease and meaningful shared reality.

		- Many people talk more than they ask—this leads to poor engagement.

		- Asking more questions increases likability and connection.

		- **Follow-up questions** show active listening and interest—called "responsiveness in action."

		- Prefer "what" questions to "why" in negotiations:
			- "What" fosters openness, while "why" can feel accusatory.

	- ## Levity
		- Boredom is a silent killer in conversations—more dangerous than anger.
		- Levity (smiles, jokes, compliments, or switching topics) keeps things lively and fun.
			- [source](https://share.snipd.com/snip/80ee5595-deff-46b0-a591-02866d829388)
		- Even bad jokes boost status; successful ones can make you group leader.

		- People laugh and smile less after age 23—levity may be even more essential in professional contexts.

		- The goal isn't to be funny, but to make the **conversation fun**.
			- Smiling and laughing alone can boost the vibe.

	- ## Kindness
		- Kindness is the capstone of the TALK framework—it ties everything together.
		- Active listening = kindness in action.
			- Show you've listened by paraphrasing, affirming, or asking relevant follow-up questions.
			- Try sequential validation exercises to build this skill.
