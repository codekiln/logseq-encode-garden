- # [Forget "Prompt Engineering." You Need AI Fluency](https://nextkicklabs.substack.com/p/forget-prompt-engineering-you-need)
	- ## Intake
		- Captured from Readwise shared link and validated against the original Substack post.
		- Published: 2025-10-21.
	- ## TL;DR
		- The post argues that "prompt engineering" is overemphasized.
		- The core skill is [[AI Fluency]]: moving from asking for answers to directing a structured workflow.
		- The author frames AI as an intern/force multiplier, not an oracle or replacement for human judgment.
	- ## Core Thesis
		- Most poor outcomes come from vague goals, not weak wording tweaks.
		- Reliable AI outcomes come from:
			- Problem decomposition before prompting.
			- Active management of chat context quality.
			- Domain-expert verification of outputs.
			- Curated, high-signal input context.
			- Human-led final editing and integration.
	- ## 5-Part "Towards AI Fluency" Framework
		- 1. Architect
			- Break complex "human-sized" goals into specific "AI-sized" tasks.
			- Use an upfront project-brief style plan before opening chat.
		- 2. Navigator
			- Detect "correction spiral" and polluted context windows.
			- Restart intentionally when iteration quality collapses.
		- 3. Expert
			- Treat model outputs as plausible drafts, not truth.
			- Use domain knowledge and explicit source-checking to catch hallucinations.
		- 4. Curator
			- Prefer better context over more context.
			- Provide high-signal inputs:
				- Instructional context (how to respond).
				- Exemplar context (what good output looks like).
				- Knowledge context (curated source material).
		- 5. Collaborator
			- Operate with DIY-AI-DIY:
				- Human as Architect.
				- AI as Intern (draft/execution).
				- Human as Editor-in-Chief (verification, synthesis, final quality).
	- ## Practical Workflow Notes
		- When quality drops after repeated corrections, restarting can be faster than continuing.
		- Pre-work (decompose + curate) is presented as the biggest leverage point.
		- The post emphasizes durable thinking patterns over prompt "hacks."
	- ## Why This Matters
		- In high-noise AI environments, personal expertise becomes a quality-control layer.
		- The value shifts from "writing clever prompts" to designing and governing a repeatable human-AI workflow.
