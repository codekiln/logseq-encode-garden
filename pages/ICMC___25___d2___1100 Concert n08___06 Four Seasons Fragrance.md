- # Four Seasons Fragrance , for cello and fixed media
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- 20:16 [[Person/Chih-Yi (Joy) Chu]]'s sensitivity and virtuosity seem effortless. The vector fields in the visuals are mesmerizing. Kind of impressionist, So absolute, are ... these from monet? It almost seems so, but I can't quite tell - it never resolves, ... each season is represented.  So beautifuly performed. Sumptuous. Reminds me of that Robin Williams movie ... What Dreams may Come.
		- The concept of the piece reminds me of the [[NASA/Symphonies of the Planets]], with is cross-medium transference.
		- I wonder what instructions she is receivingin her earbuds.
		- The electronics are not as much of a presence here, but the composition is awesome.
		- Aesthetically this seems really compelling
	- ## #Description
		- Have friends ever heard of the [[Person/Marcel Proust]] phenomenon? For example, when people smell a certain odor, they will recall the scene where they once smelled this odor. The work takes the unique scents representing the four seasons as the development thread of the music.
		- ==Based on the composer’s true feelings, several scents are selected, such as woody scent, refreshing scent, grassy scent, floral scent and fruity scent.==
		- Express the flavor of the seasons through musical language. Meanwhile, based on the characteristics of olfactory perception, design five sections: late autumn, winter, spring, summer and early autumn, and map the olfactory perception features to the spatial and frequency parameters of the music. Through the interaction between the cello and computer music, the scents of the four seasons are transformed into auditory language. The on-site installed odor player and the ==audience’s electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide real-time feedback, creating an immersive space of “olfactory perception audio”.== By anchoring the seasonal frequencies with odor coordinates, the audience can hear the code of time’s passage amid the woody scent of late autumn and the floral fragrance of midsummer.
