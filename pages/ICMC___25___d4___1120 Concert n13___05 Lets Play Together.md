		- 21:01 two versions of him projected from top, left in black and white, right in color, not as delayed
		- about time?
		- now there are three - the top is green and red and solarized. are they at different time dialaitons?
		- what type of harmony is this?
		- it's hard to tell .... i've see something like this at the screening room last night ...
		- the fourth is cmyk, and is shifting back and forth. the first three were slwow, slower, slowest, but the fourth is quite slow but moving back and forth with colors bright.
		- 21:05 now they are getting removed one by one
		- ### Break
	- ## #Description
		- #Short
			- A meditation on latency and presence: the solo pianist duets with delayed video clones while electronics stretch and fold the acoustic signal, questioning co-presence in networked music.
		- #Long
			- **Let’s play together? **A doppelgänger phenomenon has existed for centuries in mythology, literature, visual art, and later cinema and television. It is about the idea of a biologically unrelated but look-alike, or a double of a living person (usually considered evil version of the original). So far, I’ve never met one in my life. However, if I meet him one day, the first thing I will ask him (or them) would be: “Let’s play together?”

			- **Alexey Logunov** is a composer and pianist with a primary focus on contemporary and experimental music. His music explores textural density, timbral complexity, and fusion of acoustic and electronic sound worlds. He is inspired by a broad range of styles, from the emotional depth of late romanticism to dynamic energy of progressive rock and heavy metal. Alexey was born in Leningrad, Russia. He graduated in 2014 from Saint-Petersburg State Conservatory of Rimsky-Korsakov, where he studied composition with Vladimir Tsitovich and Gennady Banshchikov and was later assistant to Sergei Slonimsky. Logunov studied piano performance at Saint Petersburg Conservatory, mentored by Ekaterina Murina from 2016 to 2018. In 2020, he earned a Master of Music degree in Composition from the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, where he studied with P. Q. Phan, Eugene O’Brien, and Tansy Davies. Logunov is now a doctoral student and recipient of a fellowship from the Composition Department at the Jacobs School.
