	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- probably won't work on a modern [[MacOS]] computer; last instructions were for [[Mac/OS/10/15]]
		- that said, the [downloads page](https://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/downloads.html) has Scale archive, version 93, Jan 2025:Â [https://www.huygens-fokker.org/docs/scales.zip](https://www.huygens-fokker.org/docs/scales.zip), which has most of the [[Music Scales]] one might want, and these can be imported into other software.
