	- [Definition of a Digital Twin](https://www.digitaltwinconsortium.org/initiatives/the-definition-of-a-digital-twin/) [[Digital Twin/Consortium/Definition of a Digital Twin]]
		- > A digital twin is an integrated data-driven virtual representation of real-world entities and processes, with synchronized interaction at a specified frequency and fidelity.
		- > Digital Twins are motivated by outcomes, driven by use cases, powered by integration, built on data, enhanced by physics, guided by domain knowledge, and implemented in dependable and trustworthy IT/OT/ET systems.
		- > Digital Twin Systems transform business by accelerating and automating holistic understanding, continuous improvement, decision-making, and interventions through effective action.
		- > Digital Twin Systems are built on integrated and synchronized IT/OT/ET systems, use real-time and historical data to represent the past and present, and simulate predicted futures.
		- > Digital Twin Prototypes use data to model and simulate predicted futures before being integrated into IT/OT/ET Systems and before synchronization with the real-world entity or process.
