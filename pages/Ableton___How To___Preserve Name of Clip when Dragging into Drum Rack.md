# How to preserve the name of an [[Ableton/Clip]] when dragging it into a [[Ableton/Instrument/Drum Rack]]
	- I started dragging [[Ableton/Clip]] in, it's #Annoying that the name of the clip doesn't populate in the [[Ableton/Instrument/Drum Rack]] front panel or in the sampler. at least it correctly populates the start and end times, though, in the [[Ableton/Instrument/Simpler]] that is created for it upon dragging it in. Workaround is to quickly enter Clip Rename.
	- Manual Workaround
		- 1 - quickly enter rename view in [[Ableton/Browser]] on the clip with Cmd+R
		- 2 - copy the name
		- 3 - drag the clip to the drum rack
		- 4 - Select the newly dragged in clip in the Drum Rack and use Cmd+R, Cmd+V, Return to paste it in and confirm
		- 5 - Select the created [[Ableton/Instrument/Simpler]] for the clip and use Cmd+R, Cmd+V to paste in the name there, too
			- Don't confirm with the Return key here because otherwise it will enter in the [[Ableton/Remote Control]] mode. Instead, click elsewhere to confirm.
