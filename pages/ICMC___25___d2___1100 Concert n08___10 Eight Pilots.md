# Eight Pilots: The Fall of Younger Brother Lin Heng from the Sky
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- 21:09 begins with planes flying overhead in the dark
		- now we have some birds, and some ballet dancer dancing to some revelry
		- this is movie for a film which is a ballet set in ... WWII ish time? - the soundtrack reminds me of a 90's movie, with original score.
		- what is the role of AI here? is it  actually composed by AI?
		- 21:14 now two pilots are definitely battling
		- The air raid sirens are definitely American Air raid sirens
		- was this whole thing generated, even the video?
	- ## #Description
		- (from the original ballroom dance drama April Days on Earth)
		- The original ballroom dance drama “April Days on Earth” masterfully blends Chinese traditional culture with the vocabulary of ballroom dance. Using ballroom dance as its medium, the drama vividly portrays prominent historical figures from modern China, effectively integrating traditional Chinese culture with modern international art forms, showcasing cross-cultural exchanges and highlighting the openness and inclusiveness of Eastern culture with strong cultural confidence. Inspired by Lin Huiyin’s modern poem written in 1934, the drama captures the gentle elegance and hopeful atmosphere of the poem, perfectly embodying its overall style. By intertwining history with poetic narrative, it affectionately illustrates Lin Huiyin’s devotion to Chinese architectural research and the preservation of the nation’s historical architecture, emotionally reenacting the patriotic story of this remarkable woman. The episode “Eight Pilots: The Fall of Younger Brother Lin Heng from the Sky” coincides with the discovery of Foguang Temple, the same year as the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. The harsh winter of national crisis soon followed. Lin Huiyin and Liang Sicheng relocated with Southwest Associated University to Kunming, where eight youthful pilots generously provided a small house for the Liang family. They soon became like family, living closely together. When the devastating bombings finally arrived in Kunming, the eight pilots bravely took to the skies to confront the Japanese forces and heroically sacrificed their lives for their country. Lin Huiyin’s younger brother, Lin Heng, also courageously perished the following year in an air battle over Chengdu. Stricken with grief, Lin Huiyin penned the mournful elegy “Mourning My Third Brother Heng.”
		- Voice-over Text： In July 1937, just as we discovered Foguang Temple, winter quietly fell upon our homeland—China, the war had begun. Si Cheng and I travelled with the National Southwestern Associated University to Kunming. Amid hardship, we were cared for by eight young fighter pilots, who clung to us with a tender, childlike devotion. A quiet bond took root between us. My brother Lin Heng, like them, was noble and kind, his heart full of love for his country. Their training was not for glory, but for the day they might offer all they had—even their lives—for China. O brother! My brother! No fitting words of mine mourning your death — It is the call of the time for you, More impossible in the future to express my love to you, Yet it will remain forever in the sky. This ruthless feat is the poetry of our time; This silent glory is the glaring you.
