- # Interactive Audiobook with Real-Time RAG
	- ## Concept
		- Combine pre-recorded narration of essays or educational content with OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode.
		- Users can interrupt playback to ask questions.
		- System responds in real-time using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
	- ## Idea Description, Context and Adjacent Ideas
		- In this idea I propose an interactive audiobook system that combines pre-recorded narration (perhaps created with OpenAI whisper or other high-quality text to speech models) with a system such as OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode to enable real-time question-and-answer interaction.
		- As users listen, they can interrupt the narration to ask context-aware questions, which are answered in Advanced Voice Mode AI. The AI is already primed with context of the text prior to the user asking any question or making any comment.
		- Technically, this isn't RAG at all, since in an early prototype the entire context would be pre-loaded. In a later prototype, perhaps context would be periodically pre-warmed into the context. Or perhaps pre-warming wouldn't be necessary to achieve real-time results.
		- The system would track the user's position in the text and maintain a personalized history of queries and responses, enabling deeper engagement and continuity. Exiting voice mode would show highlighted sections along with related dialogs. Some of these could optionally be published, and others would have the ability to continue those discussions in text or in audio format.
		- Additionally, the underlying text model supports associating selections with Q&A metadata, allowing enriched playback, annotation, or review modes that highlight user-driven exploration within the content.
	- ## Pipeline
		- 1. **Preprocessing**: Extract and store the essay content.
		- 2. **Narration**: Use a high-quality text-to-speech engine to read the essay aloud.
		- 3. **Voice Mode Interaction**:
			- When user interrupts:
				- Pause narration.
				- Capture user query via speech-to-text.
				- Use OpenAI RAG or context-aware inference on essay content.
				- Convert response to audio via Advanced Voice Mode.
				- Resume narration after answer.
	- ## Architecture Notes
		- Essay content is preloaded as context in the session.
		- Maintain a dynamic position pointer in essay text.
		- Use local chunk summaries to reduce token load.
		- No need for live RAG if context window suffices.
	- ## Limitations
		- Advanced Voice Mode has session length and daily cap limitations.
		- Currently no support for file uploadsâ€”context must be preloaded text.
		- Requires app logic to manage when to switch between narration and Q&A.
	- ## Prototype Suggestions
		- Use pre-recorded audio for narration.
		- Keep a running summary of current position.
		- Implement interruption handler that injects context from nearby chunk.
	- ## Applications
		- **Education**: Students ask clarifying questions while listening to an audio version of required text reading.
		- **Accessibility**: Audio-first interfaces for essays, documentation, or even audiobooks.
		- **Productivity**: Listen to documents while querying them in real-time.
