- # Accumulation of Corpuscules
	- ## Overview
		- Exploration of accumulation processes involving sound corpuscles (small sound particles) in acousmatic music
		- Accumulation of corpuscules examines how individual sound particles combine to form larger sonic structures
		- Understanding the process of building complex textures from simple sound elements
	- ## Key Concepts
		- Corpuscules: Small, discrete sound particles or grains
		- Accumulation: The process of gathering and combining individual sound particles
		- Density: The concentration of corpuscles in a given time/space
		- Transformation: How accumulated corpuscles create new sonic qualities and textures
	- ## Sound Examples
		- *Note: Sound examples should be added from the website with media player hyperlinks*
		- Example format: {{embed [[Person/Composer Name/Piece Title]]}}
