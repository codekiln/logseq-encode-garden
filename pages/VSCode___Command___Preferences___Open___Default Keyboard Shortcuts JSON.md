# Preferences: Open Default Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- This command opens up a JSON file that has many keyboard shortcuts.
			- Unfortunately, it's unclear what this commands.
				- Related VSCode docs:
					- [[VSCode/Docs/Default keyboard shortcuts reference]]
						- doesn't mention much about what keyboard shortcuts are included or not
		- this is a read-only (locked) file
		- It does appear that this includes #Keyshorts from installed [[VSCode Extensions]]. Searching in the file for a given installed VSCode extension does return results in it.
			- I think that layering in the [[VSCode/File/keybindings.json]] from [[VSCode/Command/Preferences/Open/Keyboard Shortcuts JSON]] on top of this would likely give the complete picture of active keyboard shortcuts.
