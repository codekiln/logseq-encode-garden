			- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbwFwtdLMT8}}
				- 🔄 **Understanding the Diff View**: Clicking a file in the Source Control view in VS Code opens its diff view, where changes can be reviewed or edited unless staged.
				- 🛠️ **Opening the Original File**: Use the "**open file**" icons in the Source Control view or the top bar to access the original file directly.
				- 🚀 **Using the Command Palette**: Execute the [[VSCode/Command/Git/Open File]] command via Ctrl+Shift+P (Command+Shift+P on Mac) to open the file on disk.
