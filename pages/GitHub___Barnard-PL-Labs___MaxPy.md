- [Barnard-PL-Labs/MaxPy: A Python package for automated generation of MaxMSP patches.](https://github.com/Barnard-PL-Labs/MaxPy)
	- MaxPy is a Python package for metaprogramming of MaxMSP that uses Python to generate and edit Max patches. MaxPy allows users to move freely between text-based Python programming and visual programming in Max, making it much easier to implement dynamic patches, random patches, mass-placement and mass-connection of objects, and other easily text-programmed techniques.
	- MaxPy was published as a [demo paper](https://github.com/Barnard-PL-Labs/MaxPy/blob/main/MaxPy-NIME-2023-Paper.pdf) for NIME 2023. See it in the [[NIME]] proceedings here -
