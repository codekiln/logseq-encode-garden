- # `OPENAI_API_VERSION` -
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- to find the latest version, go to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azureopenai/models/list and look in the model drop down at right and pick the latest one - either the one that ends with `-preview` or the latest one that does not (whichever you prefer). I tend to use the `-preview` versions.
		- Latest non `-preview` version as of [[2025-08-21 Thu]] is `2024-10-21`, and latest `-preview` version is `2025-03-01-preview`.
