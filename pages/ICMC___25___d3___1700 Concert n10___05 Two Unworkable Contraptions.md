- # Two Unworkable Contraptions for amplified #Flute and electronics
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- 17:55 hauntingly emersive. tickles my thrum chamber in its gradual emergence. organ-like clushes.
		- TODO attach #YouTube #Video
		- 17:58 speech-like swirles whirr about, louder now, like a spirit
		- [[Person/Patricio de la Cuadra]] is a fantastic performer; extended techniques are so natrally woven in. He is an expert in physical modeling, both conceptually and in terms of performance
		- the clicks on the flute become something more
		- 18:01 some evolution - I see the score in the composer's hands, he's monitoring the max patch too

		- **Patricio de la Cuadra** is a flutist, engineer, and professor at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. He holds a ==PhD in Acoustics from Stanford University== and specializes in the study of wind instrument acoustics, ==physical modeling==, and the design and fabrication of historical and contemporary instruments. His research integrates scientific rigor with artistic practice, bridging experimental acoustics, digital signal processing, and performance. Through interdisciplinary teaching and creative research, he investigates the material and perceptual dimensions of sound, aiming to expand the dialogue between science, technology, and the performing arts.

		- **Tomás Koljatic S.** is a Chilean composer. After completing undergraduate degrees in music and mathematics in his home country, he continued his training in composition at the Paris Conservatory (CNSMDP), where he studied under Frédéric Durieux (composition), Claude Ledoux (analysis), Denis Cohen (orchestration), and Luis Naón, Tom Mays, and Karim Haddad (music and technology). In parallel, he pursued further specialization in computer music at IRCAM (Cursus 1). He is currently a faculty member at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, where he teaches music analysis and history.
	- ## #Description
		- Two Unworkable Contraptions for amplified flute and electronics, is the result of a collaboration with instrumentalist and researcher Patricio de la Cuadra. The raw material for the electronic part ==comes from a physical model originally developed by de la Cuadra himself== (who also performs the flute part in this concert). This computer model, initially conceived to study the acoustics of wind instruments, allows for the generation of sounds that convincingly simulate real instruments through the control of their physical parameters. It also enables the creation of “virtual” instruments that would exceed the limits of a human performer (for example, a performer with endless lung capacity), or the practical limits of instrument construction (such as simulating pipes of arbitrarily large dimensions). This tool offers the composer an infinite range of sounds and timbres, from those close to familiar instrumental sounds to others with a distinctly synthetic character, yet with great potential to blend together and to combine with the sounds of a live flute. This project was funded by the Office for the Arts and Culture of the Vice Presidency for Research, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.
