	- ## What problem does [[Model Context Protocol]] solve?
	  ![MCP problem solved](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34123523-7082-4895-b8e4-b26077683c61_1610x868.png){:height 395, :width 718}
		- ### What does this mean ... for [[AI Coding]]? AI Agents in Code editors can now ...
		  * develop technical plans using Jira, Confluence
		  * submit merge requests to GitHub, GitLab, etc
		  * check out a ticket and start working on it
		  * introspect into database, etc
	- ## Side-note - [[Latent Space/Blog/25/03/Why MCP Won]]
		- this talk possibly contributed to MCP going viral in [[2025/03]] 
		  > At current pace, **MCP will overtake OpenAPI in July**

		- [[Person/Mahesh Murag]]'s talk likely contributed to MCP taking over AI social media feeds
		  ![the twitter hype](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc325ceca-4bdf-44cf-b727-978bb49a89e1_1106x1716.png){:height 551, :width 299}
	- ## The Problem MCP Solves
		- Before MCP, AI application development was fragmented:
		  * Each team developed custom logic (and prompts!) for integrating data, tools, and context into AI apps.
		  * Significant duplication and complexity within companies.
		  * Difficult to reuse components across AI projects.
	- ## Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP)
		- MCP standardizes interactions between AI apps (clients) and external systems (servers).
		  ![MCP standardized interactions](../assets/image_1740238166470_0.png){:height 358, :width 684}
		- Inspired by [[GraphQL]] and [[Language Server Protocol]].
		  ![Apis -> LSP -> MCP](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F287e9c38-db9a-4abb-9a88-bc3e3e590355_2252x1214.png)
		- Three interaction types: Tools, Resources, Prompts.
		  ![MCP Deep-Dive](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe07df610-fa0b-4e18-bca5-6ade934cb64a_2274x1264.png)
	- ## Rapid Adoption of MCP
		- Major companies quickly adopted MCP:
		  * Cloudflare, Shopify, IBM, GitHub, Docker, Replit, and more.
		  * Over **1,100** community-built MCP servers available.
		  * Industry leaders predicting MCP to become standard in AI integration.
		  ![Rapid adoption](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczP4Thkxk-MhVQqm9JdoNSJJnXEiyYdY63F3jsPJVgFoK7Y2HECKVBPS9xXg6sttqCWn-O-4IDyFER4iKyijKOIK0spyAtg4gTrEqxKnHE3xdWqSHjc=w1920-h1080){:height 225, :width 400}
	- ## MCP Components: Tools, Resources, and Prompts
		- ### **Tools** (*Model-controlled*)
		  * LLM knows about the tools it has access to, and uses that to **decide** when to invoke certain actions. These are tiny AI prompts made from a tool schema. Example from [[GitHub MCP]] [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/github/index.ts#L65)
			- #### declare the parameters the AI will use to call the `GetFileContents` tool in natural language
			  ```
			  const GetFileContentsSchema = z.object({
			    owner: z.string().describe("Repository owner (username or organization)"),
			    repo: z.string().describe("Repository name"),
			    path: z.string().describe("Path to the file or directory"),
			    branch: z.string().optional().describe("Branch to get contents from"),
			  });
			  ```
			- #### MCP server tools - a list of mappings between descriptions of tools and that tool's implementation in the API
			  ```
			  server.setRequestHandler(..., async () => { return { tools: [ ...{
			    name: "get_file_contents",
			    description: "Get the contents of a file or directory from a GitHub repository",
			    inputSchema: zodToJsonSchema(files.GetFileContentsSchema),
			  }, ...
			  ```
			- #### [[Key Insight]]
			  *AI tools are just a tiny LLM prompt that tells an LLM about something it can do*
			  * "get_file_contents" - supply "Repository owner (username or organization)" and "Repository name" to "Get the contents of a file or directory from a GitHub repository"
		- ### **Resources** (*Application-controlled*)
		  * **shared state** between the [[Agentic System]] and the client application
		    * #Example - in [[ChatGPT/Canvas]], this would be the canvas - both the user and the LLM know about the state of the canvas. 
		  * *NOTE: This is just an example, OpenAI doesn't use MCP for Canvas (yet?)*
		  ![chatgpt canvas](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/uZHfstpnZ78qg2HQhn7m1/25db0387b0f72c0e20c933dcb01533f5/Canvas_Hero.png?w=1080&q=90&fm=webp){:height 155, :width 320}
		- ### **[Prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts)** (User-controlled):
		  * Predefined, **user-controlled** interactions triggered by users (kinda like slash commands).
		  ![image of prompts](../assets/image_1742381645310_0.png){:height 512, :width 414}
	- ## MCP in Action: Claude AI Integration Demo
		- Claude desktop autonomously:
		  * Identifies and summarizes GitHub issues.
		  * Adds top priority tasks into user's Asana.
		  ![Claude desktop demo](../assets/image_1740239495124_0.png){:height 297, :width 412}

	  ![Pic 09](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOqy2WciToU7rlcJ4dYr_jR2P0z_P8ucVs7oOymOGc1ZNLTefHHPoXLKBrsqMNl39VR_FORrAj2FM9P_hxjY4BoGSMFV6-hHn7cc4LTosQAVNbRBJE=w1920-h1080)
	  * one of the key points of MCP is that the system can **discover new capabilities after the agent system is built**
	  * agent is an "augmented LLM" running in a loop
	  * you can let users of the agent system connect to their data and you as the developer can focus on **the core loop**
	- ## #Example [mcp-agent](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent) from  [[lastmileAI]]
	  * **`mcp-agent`** is a simple, composable framework to **build agents** using #MCP
		- Example: Agent system to do deep research on Quantum computing cybersecurity implications 
		  ![MCP-Agent project structure](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczMwwnFzwCmTQrAIOfOJwG_Hz3G5yPrx4P-1i3rBPwtx1IclV5EHvIjjmp6e7ZWYQWVpFU3dN8DwB_FnBChNN3AMkZytcjAQdmvT4gaKVgKYC_8gx5k=w1920-h1080){:height 313, :width 538}
		  * Uses **sub-agents**: `search_agent`, `fact_checker`, `report_writer`
		  * side note - [[People/Mahesh Murag]] uses [[Windsurf]] here
	- ## MCP Composability & [Sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/sampling)
	  * Every MCP client can be an MCP Server.
	  * [[MCP/Sampling]] allows **servers to request inference** from clients, ensuring **control of privacy and cost**.
	  ![Hierarchical agent diagram](../assets/image_1740241876883_0.png){:height 225, :width 400}
	- ## MCP Inspector & OAuth Authentication
	  * Inspector provides debugging for MCP connections.
	  * OAuth integration simplifies secure service authentication. Scoped permission boundaries can apply.
	  ![MCP Inspector OAuth](../assets/image_1740242601017_0.png){:height 225, :width 400}
	- ## Autonomous Discovery
	  * Official MCP Registry provides centralized server discovery
	  * Enables agents to find and trust verified MCP servers
	  * Example: Automatic discovery of [[Grafana]] MCP for debugging tasks
	  ![MCP Registry discovery](../assets/image_1740242405280_0.png){:height 225, :width 400}
	- ## Server Discovery
	  * Websites can expose MCP server capabilities via `.well-known/mcp.json`
	  * Enables instant discovery of service integrations
	  * Real example: [[Shopify/MCP]] integration auto-discovery
	  ![Shopify MCP discovery](../assets/image_1740243306243_0.png){:height 225, :width 400}
	- ## #MCP Key [[EdTech]] Takeaways
	  * Of course it helps [[AI Coding]] agents know more about the other systems ([[JIRA]], [[GitHub]], [[PostgreSQL]], etc)
	  * Each [[LMS/Course/Teaching Element]] could express actions AI could take on it as an [[MCP Server]]. Any AI application with permission could interact with that Teaching Element Type
	  * Each LMS could be an [[LMS/Course/Authoring]] MCP Server for AI-enhanced course development

		- ### Why Evaluate Agents?
		  * Task ambiguity
		  * Missing context
		  * Excessive or ambiguous tool usage
		  * Poor reasoning
		  * Solutions include combining deterministic logic with agentic logic for better control flow
		- ### Evaluating Application Versions Over Time
		  * Evaluations track progress through new prompts, models, and architectures
		  * Metrics help verify improvements
		  ![Application Progress](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOuO9nArnqeYQs4cVrYo86h68jjSgzDZmm_PLNxlFoVSmZ1DBjWTF0adrQAXjndc_RiJmeeH6r0pukA0ROKCUpWekmflE96esfFdfu0USmfJcE9R5k=w680-h383)
		- ### Defining Effective Evaluators
		  * Test agent outputs against ground-truth datasets
		  * Evaluators calculate accuracy, hallucination rates, and other metrics

		  * Evaluations performed at different task levels (queries, document retrieval, hallucination checks)
		  ![Granular Eval](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOoZtHmdnzv65-hxJY2hOrUgR3fCPyvfCQF2Bk9-zFwKuSV8a4R0oWLoC5n7TmJpu2b9eox-vrTptORYN7sa7AlF56L5EuxvpU2T-6Ajha3sWj7TpQ=w680-h383)
		- ### **Multi-turn conversations can be tested individually, or in series**
		  ![image.png](../assets/image_1740256078101_0.png)
		- The structure of how one tests is also determined by the structure of the conversation
		- if your conversation has phases, and you need to make assertions against phases, individual tests for phases may make sense
		- The structure of the golden datasets match the expected structure of how one tests

	- ## Workshop 3 - Key Takeaways for [[EdTech]]
	  * [[LangSmith/Evaluator/Offline]] are conducted from [[CICD]] as part of the pull request process
	    * they are powered by a ground truth collection of curated labels in a golden dataset
	  * [[LangSmith/Evaluator/Online]] evaluations are "good enough, quickly" for live-use cases
	  * For **phased conversations**, **each phase should be separately evaluated**
	  * Each part of the application should be tested in isolation
	  * In truly [[Agentic Systems]], you need to also evaluate the [[AI/Tool/Calling]]
- # [[AIES 25 WS 4 – Multi-Agent Workflows with MCP – Dan Mason]]
	- ### Why Multi-Agent Workflows?
		- **"Agents aren't really agents unless they can discover and act beyond the chatbox."**
		- MCP (**Model Context Protocol**) enables agents to interact dynamically with the environment.
		- Allows agents to:
		  * Discover external resources
		  * Interact beyond simple chat interfaces
		  * Execute complex, context-sensitive tasks
