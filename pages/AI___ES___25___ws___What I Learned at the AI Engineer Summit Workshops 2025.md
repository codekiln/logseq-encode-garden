		- [[Person/Mahesh Murag]]'s talk likely contributed to MCP taking over AI social media feeds
		  ![the twitter hype](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc325ceca-4bdf-44cf-b727-978bb49a89e1_1106x1716.png){:height 551, :width 299}
	- ## The Problem MCP Solves
		- Before MCP, AI application development was fragmented:
		  * Each team developed custom logic (and prompts!) for integrating data, tools, and context into AI apps.
		  * Significant duplication and complexity within companies.
		  * Difficult to reuse components across AI projects.
	- ## Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP)
		- MCP standardizes interactions between AI apps (clients) and external systems (servers).
		  ![MCP standardized interactions](../assets/image_1740238166470_0.png){:height 358, :width 684}
		- Inspired by [[GraphQL]] and [[Language Server Protocol]].
		  ![Apis -> LSP -> MCP](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F287e9c38-db9a-4abb-9a88-bc3e3e590355_2252x1214.png)
		- Three interaction types: Tools, Resources, Prompts.
		  ![MCP Deep-Dive](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe07df610-fa0b-4e18-bca5-6ade934cb64a_2274x1264.png)
	- ## Rapid Adoption of MCP
		- Major companies quickly adopted MCP:
		  * Cloudflare, Shopify, IBM, GitHub, Docker, Replit, and more.
		  * Over **1,100** community-built MCP servers available.
		  * Industry leaders predicting MCP to become standard in AI integration.
		  ![Rapid adoption](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczP4Thkxk-MhVQqm9JdoNSJJnXEiyYdY63F3jsPJVgFoK7Y2HECKVBPS9xXg6sttqCWn-O-4IDyFER4iKyijKOIK0spyAtg4gTrEqxKnHE3xdWqSHjc=w1920-h1080){:height 225, :width 400}
	- ## MCP Components: Tools, Resources, and Prompts
		- ### **Tools** (*Model-controlled*)
		  * LLM knows about the tools it has access to, and uses that to **decide** when to invoke certain actions. These are tiny AI prompts made from a tool schema. Example from [[GitHub MCP]] [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/github/index.ts#L65)
			- #### declare the parameters the AI will use to call the `GetFileContents` tool in natural language
			  ```
			  const GetFileContentsSchema = z.object({
			    owner: z.string().describe("Repository owner (username or organization)"),
			    repo: z.string().describe("Repository name"),
			    path: z.string().describe("Path to the file or directory"),
			    branch: z.string().optional().describe("Branch to get contents from"),
			  });
			  ```
			- #### MCP server tools - a list of mappings between descriptions of tools and that tool's implementation in the API
			  ```
			  server.setRequestHandler(..., async () => { return { tools: [ ...{
			    name: "get_file_contents",
			    description: "Get the contents of a file or directory from a GitHub repository",
			    inputSchema: zodToJsonSchema(files.GetFileContentsSchema),
			  }, ...
			  ```
			- #### [[Key Insight]]
			  *AI tools are just a tiny LLM prompt that tells an LLM about something it can do*
			  * "get_file_contents" - supply "Repository owner (username or organization)" and "Repository name" to "Get the contents of a file or directory from a GitHub repository"
		- ### **Resources** (*Application-controlled*)
		  * **shared state** between the [[Agentic System]] and the client application
		    * #Example - in [[ChatGPT/Canvas]], this would be the canvas - both the user and the LLM know about the state of the canvas. 
		  * *NOTE: This is just an example, OpenAI doesn't use MCP for Canvas (yet?)*
		  ![chatgpt canvas](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/uZHfstpnZ78qg2HQhn7m1/25db0387b0f72c0e20c933dcb01533f5/Canvas_Hero.png?w=1080&q=90&fm=webp){:height 155, :width 320}
		- ### **[Prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts)** (User-controlled):
		  * Predefined, **user-controlled** interactions triggered by users (kinda like slash commands).
		  ![image of prompts](../assets/image_1742381645310_0.png){:height 512, :width 414}
	- ## MCP in Action: Claude AI Integration Demo
		- Claude desktop autonomously:
		  * Identifies and summarizes GitHub issues.
		  * Adds top priority tasks into user's Asana.
		  ![Claude desktop demo](../assets/image_1740239495124_0.png){:height 297, :width 412}

	  * one of the key points of MCP is that the system can **discover new capabilities after the agent system is built**
	  * agent is an "augmented LLM" running in a loop
	  * you can let users of the agent system connect to their data and you as the developer can focus on **the core loop**
	- ## #Example [mcp-agent](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent) from  [[lastmileAI]]
	  * **`mcp-agent`** is a simple, composable framework to **build agents** using #MCP
		- Example: Agent system to do deep research on Quantum computing cybersecurity implications 
		  ![MCP-Agent project structure](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczMwwnFzwCmTQrAIOfOJwG_Hz3G5yPrx4P-1i3rBPwtx1IclV5EHvIjjmp6e7ZWYQWVpFU3dN8DwB_FnBChNN3AMkZytcjAQdmvT4gaKVgKYC_8gx5k=w1920-h1080){:height 313, :width 538}
		  * Uses **sub-agents**: `search_agent`, `fact_checker`, `report_writer`
		  * side note - [[People/Mahesh Murag]] uses [[Windsurf]] here
	- ## MCP Composability & [Sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/sampling)
	  * Every MCP client can be an MCP Server.
	  * [[MCP/Sampling]] allows **servers to request inference** from clients, ensuring **control of privacy and cost**.
	  ![Hierarchical agent diagram](../assets/image_1740241876883_0.png){:height 225, :width 400}
	- ## MCP Inspector & OAuth Authentication
	  * Inspector provides debugging for MCP connections.
	  * OAuth integration simplifies secure service authentication. Scoped permission boundaries can apply.
	  ![MCP Inspector OAuth](../assets/image_1740242601017_0.png){:height 225, :width 400}
	- ## Autonomous Discovery
	  * Official MCP Registry provides centralized server discovery
	  * Enables agents to find and trust verified MCP servers
	  * Example: Automatic discovery of [[Grafana]] MCP for debugging tasks
	  ![MCP Registry discovery](../assets/image_1740242405280_0.png){:height 225, :width 400}
	- ## Server Discovery
	  * Websites can expose MCP server capabilities via `.well-known/mcp.json`
	  * Enables instant discovery of service integrations
	  * Real example: [[Shopify/MCP]] integration auto-discovery
	  ![Shopify MCP discovery](../assets/image_1740243306243_0.png){:height 225, :width 400}
	- ## #MCP Key [[EdTech]] Takeaways
	  * Of course it helps [[AI Coding]] agents know more about the other systems ([[JIRA]], [[GitHub]], [[PostgreSQL]], etc)
	  * Each [[LMS/Course/Teaching Element]] could express actions AI could take on it as an [[MCP Server]]. Any AI application with permission could interact with that Teaching Element Type
	  * Each LMS could be an [[LMS/Course/Authoring]] MCP Server for AI-enhanced course development

- # [[AIES 25 WS 4 â€“ Multi-Agent Workflows with MCP â€“ Dan Mason]]
	- ### Why Multi-Agent Workflows?
		- **"Agents aren't really agents unless they can discover and act beyond the chatbox."**
		- MCP (**Model Context Protocol**) enables agents to interact dynamically with the environment.
