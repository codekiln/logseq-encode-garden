			- In particular, I'm interested in reading theÂ [Deliberative Alignment paper](https://openai.com/index/deliberative-alignment/)Â [he mentioned at 13:48](https://youtu.be/8rABwKRsec4?t=828), where an [[AI/Model/Spec]] ( #Example:  [[OpenAI/GitHub/model_spec]]Â (what I have been calling an [[AI/Behavior/Catalog]])) would be used by a more powerful [[LLM-as-Judge]] to score the input output pair, which then was fed back into fine-tuning.

			- In an era where AI transforms software development, the most valuable skill isn't writing code - it's communicating intent with precision. This talk reveals how specifications, not prompts or code, are becoming the fundamental unit of programming, and why spec-writing is the new superpower.
			- Drawing from production experience, we demonstrate how rigorous, versioned specifications serve as the source of truth that compiles to documentation, evaluations, model behaviors, and maybe even code.
			- Just as the US Constitution acts as a versioned spec with judicial review as its grader, AI systems need executable specifications that align both human teams and machine intelligence. We'll look at OpenAI's Model Spec as a real-world example.
			- Finally, we'll end on some open questions about what the future of developer tooling looks like in a world where communication once again becomes the most important artifact in engineering.
			- About [[Person/Sean Grove]]
				- Sean Grove works on alignment reasoning at OpenAI, helping translate highâ€‘level intent into enforceable specs and evaluations. Before OpenAI he founded OneGraph, a [[GraphQL]] developerâ€‘tools startup later acquired by [[Netlify]]. He has delivered dozens of technical talks worldwide on developer tooling, APIs, AI UX and design, and now alignment.
				- Recorded at the AI Engineer World's Fair in San Francisco.

			- ðŸ†• **Structured communication is the bottleneck. Whoever communicates best becomes the most valuable programmer.**
			- As LLMs increasingly do more and more code generation, the need for clear communication with Agents and with Humans goes *up*.
			- The clearest artifact of communication is a **specification**, whether it is a PRD between PMs and Engineers, the US constitution between government and its people, OpenAI's model spec for LLMs.
			- Sean applies the Model Spec to the GPT 4o glazegate issue - which actually preserved trust in the community that sycophancy was a bug! And since everything is a spec... we should think hard about how good specs are written, as we write them for our own AIs.
