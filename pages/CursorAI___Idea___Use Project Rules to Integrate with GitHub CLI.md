# Using [[CursorAI/Project Rules]] with the [[GitHub/CLI]]
- ## Impetus
	- Most of the use cases for Cursor that are seen on social media concern using CursorAI for coding.  Cursor would be more helpful if it could be more of a software engineer, interacting with the GitHub repository as a whole across the software engineering lifecycle.
	- For example, Cursor could help with:
		- drafting [Github Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) and Sub-Isssues
		- [Using labels and milestones to track work - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work)
		- maintaining issue statuses on the [Github Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)
		- checking out issues in a branch
		- submitting a well-formed merge request with a great description that references the issue(s) it closes
		- checking on status of github actions
	- Many of the advanced uses of Cursor require doing up-front planning about the design of the feature; see [[CursorAI/Technique/Frontload Design]].
- ## Project Rules
	- When using [[CursorAI/Agent Mode]], cursor can craft CLI command invocations for the GitHub CLI, `gh`. This means that [[CursorAI/Project Rules]] can be crafted to utilize this CLI for certain points in the [[Software/Engineering/Development Life Cycle (SLDC)]], such as
		- crafting a new issue's description
		- checking out an issue to a new branch
	- Using the [[GitHub/CLI/gh/issue/view]], one can download [[GitHub/Issue]]s to [[Markdown]] files locally.
	- This
	- The `gh` CLI also allows creating github issues that have a body from a local markdown file.
