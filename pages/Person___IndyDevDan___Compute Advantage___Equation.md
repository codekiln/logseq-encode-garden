# Compute Advantage Equation and [Calculator](https://agenticengineer.com/compute-advantage-equation) - via [[Person/IndyDevDan/YouTube/25/04/One framework for evaluating AI Coding]]
	- **Compute Advantage** = ( **Compute Scaling** ร **Autonomy** ) รท ( **Time** + **Effort** + **Monetary Cost** )
	- **Definitions**
		- **Compute Scaling**: Raw intelligence and capability of your model
		- **Autonomy**: How much/well your AI tools can operate without you
		- **Time**: Calendar time from start to completion
		- **Effort**: Mental energy you spend on the task
		- **Monetary Cost**: Direct financial expense of tools and services
	- **Insight**
		- The higher your compute scaling and autonomy, and the lower your time, effort, and monetary cost, the greater your compute advantage as an engineer.
