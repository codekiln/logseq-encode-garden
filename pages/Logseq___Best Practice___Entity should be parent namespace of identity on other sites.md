tags:: [[Logseq/Namespace]]

- # Best Practice - Don't create `YouTube/MyUser/XYZ` and `GitHub/myuser/XYZ` and `Person/Name` separately; instead, nest under person so they can be found when you're at the person node
	- ## #Examples
		- instead of Reddit/cursor/XYZ, have CursorAI/reddit/XYZ
		- instead of Person/Name and GitHub/username or YouTube/username, have Person/Github/username
	- ## why?
		- because it's more important to center [[Logseq/Namespace]]s around the entity being modeled.
			- Having an absolutely gigantic namespace under Reddit isn't going to help anyone find anything
			- it's also more portable and extensible; since people likely don't want to copy in your whole reddit namespace, but they may want to copy in individual people into their logseq garden
