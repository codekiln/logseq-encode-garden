	- Key learnings from comparing 12 PKMs to Logseq:
		- ## Click to zoom outlining
			- Ever since I've first used Workflowy, I've never wanted to use a note taking app that didn't have this, and yet very few PKMs implement this
			- Besides Logseq, only Orca and Tana have it, though there is a plugin that will implement it in Obsidian
		- ## Full fledged task manager
			- Most PKMs have some kind of task check boxes, and some have the ability to expand on those via "supertags"
			- Very few have built-in task managers that let you assign a status and a deadline to individual tasks, not to mention having repeating tasks and priorities
			- Besides Logseq only Amplenote fit the bill, though there are plugins for Orca and Obsidian that bring them a bit closer to Logseq
		- ## Aliases
			- Aliases are essential for multilingual environments to refer to the same thing using different languages
			- Having true aliases makes the wikilinks feature work regardless of which word is used
			- Besides Logseq, only Remnote, Reflect, Orca, and Siyuan have this ability
