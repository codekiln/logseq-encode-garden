- # LangChain and LangGraph Agent Frameworks Reach v1.0 Milestones
	- ## Metadata
		- **Author:** Sydney Runkle and the LangChain OSS team
		- **Published:** October 22, 2024
		- **Source:** [LangChain Blog](https://blog.langchain.com/)
		- **Annotated in Readwise:** [Link](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01k8njj6z4zxywfzx8pbj4q13j)
	- ## Key Highlights
		- LangChain 1.0 and LangGraph 1.0 released - first major versions
		- Updated `langchain` to focus on core agent loop
		- New middleware concept for flexibility
		- Upgraded model integrations with latest content types
		- Redesigned documentation site
	- ## Framework Purposes
		- **[[LangChain]]** - Fastest way to build an AI agent with standard tool calling architecture, provider agnostic design, and middleware for customization
		- **[[LangGraph]]** - Lower level framework and runtime for highly custom and controllable agents, designed for production-grade, long running agents
	- ## LangChain 1.0 Improvements
		- ### `create_agent` Abstraction
			- Built around the core agent loop for quick startup
			- Built on LangGraph runtime for reliable agents
			- Prebuilt and user defined middleware enable step by step control and customization
			- Similar to `create_react_agent` from `langgraph.prebuilts` (used in production for a year)
		- ### Middleware System
			- Fine grained control at every step an agent takes
			- Built-in middlewares for common use cases:
				- **Human-in-the-loop:** Pause agent execution for user approval, editing, or rejection of tool calls
				- **Summarization:** Condense message history when approaching context limits
				- **PII redaction:** Identify and redact sensitive information before content is passed to the model
			- Support for custom middleware that hooks into various points in the agent loop
		- ### Structured Output Generation
			- Improved structured output generation in agent loop
			- Reduced latency and cost by eliminating extra LLM call
			- Fine grained control over structured output generation via tool calling or provider-native structured output
		- ### Standard Content Blocks
			- Provider-agnostic spec for model outputs
			- Consistent content types across providers
			- Support for reasoning traces, citations, and tool calls
			- Typed interfaces for complex response structures
			- Full backward compatibility
	- ## LangGraph 1.0 Features
		- **Durable state** - Agent execution state persists automatically
		- **Built-in persistence** - Save and resume agent workflows at any point
		- **Human-in-the-loop patterns** - First-class API support for human review
		- First stable major release in durable agent framework space
		- After more than a year of iteration and adoption by companies like [[Uber]], [[LinkedIn]], and [[Klarna]]
	- ## Breaking Changes
		- `create_react_agent` deprecated in `langgraph.prebuilt` (moved to `langchain.agents`)
		- Python 3.9 support dropped (EOL October 2025)
		- v1.0 requires Python 3.10+
		- Python 3.14 support coming soon
		- Package surface area reduced, old functionality moved to `langchain-classic`
	- ## When to Use Each Framework
		- ### Choose LangChain 1.0 for:
			- Shipping quickly with standard agent patterns
			- Agents that fit the default loop (model → tools → response)
			- Middleware-based customization
			- Higher-level abstractions over low-level control
		- ### Choose LangGraph 1.0 for:
			- Workflows with mixture of deterministic and agentic components
			- Long running business process automation
			- Sensitive workflows requiring more oversight/human in the loop
			- Highly custom or complex workflows
			- Applications where latency and/or cost need careful control
	- ## Installation
		- Python:
			- `uv pip install --upgrade langchain`
			- `uv pip install langchain-classic`
			- `uv pip install --upgrade langgraph`
		- JavaScript:
			- `npm install @langchain/langchain@latest`
			- `npm install @langchain/langchain-classic`
			- `npm install @langchain/langgraph@latest`
	- ## Migration Resources
		- Release overviews: Python, JavaScript
		- Migration guides: Python, JavaScript
	- ## New Documentation Site
		- Completely redesigned documentation site at docs.langchain.com
		- All LangChain and LangGraph docs—across Python and JavaScript—in one unified site
		- Parallel examples, shared conceptual guides, and consolidated API references
		- More intuitive navigation, thoughtful guides, and in-depth tutorials
	- ## Community Impact
		- 90M monthly downloads
		- Production applications at [[Uber]], [[JP Morgan]], [[Blackrock]], [[Cisco]], and more
		- Commitment to stability: no breaking changes until 2.0
