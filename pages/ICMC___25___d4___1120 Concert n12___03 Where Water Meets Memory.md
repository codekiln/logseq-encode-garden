			- **Where Water Meets Memory. **During the summers of 2018 and 2019, I spent time at the Anheuser-Busch Coastal Research Center (Oyster, Virginia), recording sounds including oyster reefs. Since that experience, I have thought about my lifelong relationship to water: trips to the beach as a child, a fear of deep, dark water (thalassophobia), recent collaboration with environmental scientists researching sea life, and, of course, the rising of our oceans as a function of global warming. All of these experiences swirled around compositionally for a year or two, until I began working on this piece in earnest during the beginning of 2021, while holed up in Oberlin, Ohio during the COVID-19 pandemic.
			- Creating this work, I challenged myself in several ways:
				- to use a **completely higher-order ambisonic workflow,**
				- to incorporate recorded or sampled instruments in each section, and to work in a number of different electroacoustic styles. The resulting work is for full [[Sound/Recording/Ambisonic/5th Order]] [[Ambisonic]]s, presented here as an [[Octophonic]] decoding.
				- Includes performance recordings of David Bowlin, violin, Kate Copeland, soprano, and Kevin William Davis, cello.
			- ### Sections

					- with solo #Violin

				- #### III. The Ocean (The Lull of the Sirens)
					- soprano soloists, choir
				- #### IV. The Deep (Beneath the Rain)
