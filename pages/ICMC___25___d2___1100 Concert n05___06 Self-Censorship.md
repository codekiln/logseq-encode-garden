	- ## #Description
		- **Self-censorship** is a multimedia performance representing disenfranchised and oppressed voices.
		- It combines a ==loosely improvised violin performance== with ==live processing and fixed media== featuring an [[Instrument/Flute/Bamboo]]. The live violin music interacts with the visual elements in real-time. This piece depicts the push to silence minorities, women, and other marginalized groups. While there is a strong desire to speak up, one pulls back due to fear, force, and the possibility of retribution and negative consequences. Overall, this piece depicts the tyranny and frustration that stem from having to exercise self-censorship while empowering underrepresented and powerless groups to speak up.
