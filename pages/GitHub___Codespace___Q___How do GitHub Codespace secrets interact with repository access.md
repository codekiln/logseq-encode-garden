- # How do [[GitHub/Codespace]] secrets interact with repository access?
	- Can anyone who has read access to the repository create a codespace which accesses secrets defined for that codespace? What about people who have write access?
- ## Answer
	- **No.** Read access alone does not grant access to Codespace secrets.
	- ### Key Security Rule
		- **Development environment secrets are not copied into the environment if you don't have write access to the codespace's repository.**
		- This is an explicit security measure documented by GitHub.
	- ### Types of Codespace Secrets
		- **User secrets** (personal account level)
			- Stored in your personal GitHub settings
			- You explicitly choose which repositories can access each secret
			- Only available in codespaces *you* create for repositories you've granted access to
		- **Repository secrets**
			- Require **administrator access** to create
			- Available to users with write access who create codespaces for that repo
		- **Organization secrets**
			- Require **organization owner** access to create
			- Can use access policies to limit which repositories can use them (all repos, private repos only, or a specific list)
	- ### Additional Protections
		- **PR from fork protection**: When you create a codespace from a PR branch from a fork, GitHub does *not* inject any of your codespace secrets into the environment
			- This prevents malicious PRs from exfiltrating your secrets
		- **Token scope varies by access level**:
			- Read-only access → token only allows cloning the source repo
			- Write access → token has read/write access to the repo
	- ### Summary
		- Someone with only read access to your repository:
			- ✅ Can create a codespace for that repo
			- ❌ Cannot access repository-level or organization-level secrets
			- ❌ Cannot access your personal user secrets (those are tied to your account, not the repo)
		- Someone with write access:
			- ✅ Can create a codespace and access repository/organization secrets (if configured for that repo)
			- ❌ Still cannot access *your* personal user secrets
		- Secrets are protected by requiring write access, and further protected against fork-based attacks
