- # [[ICMC/25/d6/1400 Concert 17/04 Country Roads]]
	- ## [[My Notes]] [[To Watch Again]]
		- 1st movement - fun. there were little samples of pigs, etc all reacting to his techniques. it was clearly jacked in. a bit of a ho-down vibe.
		- it's kind of a deconstruction of a ho-down.
		- 2nd movement uses some kind of wooden stick or bow - a drum stick I think.
	- ## #Description
		- Country Roads Although I have never been particularly interested in country music, I find myself attracted to many aspects of the guitar playing:
			- the control over string bend intonation
			- the pedal-steel emulations
				- oblique motion where one string remains stable while another bends
				- polyphonic potential of hybrid picking
			- open sonorities of the double and triple stops.
		- Country Roads explores these techniques, re-contextualized in a contemporary setting and augmented with electronic elements. The first movement is largely concerned with string bends.
		- The second movement employs Travis picking in the right hand, a classic country fingerstyle developed by [[Person/Merle Travis]] .
		- Movement three reveals itself to be a duet of sorts; the left-hand plays solo while the right hand renders the other part by bowing the lowest string with a drumstick.
