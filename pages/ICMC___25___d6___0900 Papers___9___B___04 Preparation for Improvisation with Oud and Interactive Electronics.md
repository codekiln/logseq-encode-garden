	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- [[To Watch Again]]
		- This was a cool presentation - [[see-also]] [[ICMC/25/d4/1120 Concert n12/06 Taqsim The Humanity of Arabs]]
		- Unfortunately, I was having some technical difficulties and missed a good part of it, but I loved the sound of the [[Instrument/oud]] and the synthesis examples.
	- ## [[AI Notes]]
		- ### 10:10 — Cultural and Musical Context of the [[Taqsim]]
			- Slide from Matthew Wright’s talk defines *taqsim* (Arabic: التقسيم) as the idiomatic form of instrumental improvisation in Arabic, Turkish, and Greek music traditions.
			- Root meaning: "to divide" — related to Arabic terms for division, split, partition, etc., shown via Google Translate sidebar.
			- Key points:
				- Taqsim uses pitch material from the maqam system.
				- Provides space for virtuosity and expression of individual style.
				- Aims to evoke **ṭarab/طرب**: an Arab aesthetic of musical enchantment—intense, joyous, secular ecstasy.
