		- > [About LiaScript](https://liascript.github.io/about/)
			- > Video and audio recordings are also hard to produce, they are “static” and one mistake or a missing fact cannot be fixed that easy.
			- > That is why I started to develop LiaScript
			- > a simple and extendable Markdown-dialect that allows sharing knowledge by creating interactive courses in an Open-Source manner, where anyone can participate and contribute
