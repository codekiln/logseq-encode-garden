alias:: [[Least Recently Used Cache]]

- # [LRU Cache Data Structure | Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/java/lru-cache)
	- A Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache **organizes items in order of use**, allowing you to **quickly identify which item hasn't been used for the longest amount of time**.
	- Picture a clothes rack, where clothes are always hung up on one side. To find the least-recently used item, look at the item on the other end of the rack.
	- Under the hood, an LRU cache is often implemented by pairing [a doubly linked list](/concept/linked-list) with [a hash map](/concept/hash-map).
