- # Is there any way to toggle the visibility of [[git/.gitignore]]'d files in the [[VSCode/Term/Sidebar]]?
	- [[VSCode Extensions]]
		- ## Chosen
			- [[VSCode/Extension/Toggle Exclude Git Ignore]]
		- ## Considered but not chosen
			- [Hide Git Ignored - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chrisbibby.hide-git-ignored)

				- default keyboard shortcuts Cmd+Shift+I conflict with [[CursorAI]] chat
				- works okay, but requires separate [[VSCode Commands]] to show and hide files
					- I'd prefer a toggle
				-
			- [[VSCode/Extension/Hide Files]]
				- looks cool, but doesn't mention gitignore at all
				- unclear whether this is going to have to be done for each repository or not
