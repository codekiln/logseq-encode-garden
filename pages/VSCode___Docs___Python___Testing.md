							- > An **Inlay Hint** in Visual Studio Code is a small piece of contextual information that appears inline in your code, often as gray, non-intrusive text. It provides additional details such as inferred types, parameter names, or other annotations, without actually altering the source code itself. These hints help you better understand the code and improve your workflow.
							- > When you enable the setting `python.analysis.inlayHints.pytestParameters` by setting it to `true`, **Pylance** (the Python language server) will show inlay hints for **inferred types** of the parameters in pytest fixtures. This means you’ll see hints that indicate the expected data type of the fixture parameters in your test functions, helping you understand what type of data is being injected into the function.
							- > For example, if you have a pytest fixture called `housing_data` that returns a tuple of Pandas DataFrames, enabling this setting might show a hint like this:
								- ```python
								  def cost_manager(housing_data):  # (train_df: DataFrame, test_df: DataFrame, target_feature: str)
								      train_df, test_df, target_feature = housing_data
								  ```
							- > The hint (`# (train_df: DataFrame, test_df: DataFrame, target_feature: str)`) appears inline and tells you that the `housing_data` parameter is inferred to be of a specific type.
