# [Custom CSS and JS Loader - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) - `be5invis.vscode-custom-css`
	- lets one customize the CSS and JS
	- there are many headings in this extension's page which highlight how challenging it can be to try to do this;
		- > every time after VSCode is updated, please re-enable Custom CSS
		- > This extension modifies some Visual Studio Code files so use it at your own risk. Currently, icons are not supported by the extension functionality that Visual Studio Code provides so this extension solves this issue by injecting code into `electron-browser/index.html`.
	- presumably I'd have to write my own change here
