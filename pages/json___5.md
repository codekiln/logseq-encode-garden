	  id:: 67c822b0-3271-41da-a14f-4f023a1f4556
		- extension to [[json]] that **aims to be easier to write and maintain by hand (e.g. for config files)**.
		- superset of [[json]]; valid JSON files will always be valid JSON5 files
			- a subset of [[ES5]]; valid JSON5 files will always be valid ES5
			- expands its syntax to include some productions from [ECMAScript 5.1](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) (ES5).
		- ### [[My Notes]]
			- allows
				- [[Code/Comment]] (both single-line and multi-line)
				- Trailing commas in objects and arrays
				- Unquoted property names
				- More relaxed string syntax
	- ## #Example
		- ```json5
		  {
		    // comments
		    unquoted: 'and you can quote me on that',
		    singleQuotes: 'I can use "double quotes" here',
		    lineBreaks: "Look, Mom! \
		  No \\n's!",
		    hexadecimal: 0xdecaf,
		    leadingDecimalPoint: .8675309, andTrailing: 8675309.,
		    positiveSign: +1,
		    trailingComma: 'in objects', andIn: ['arrays',],
		    "backwardsCompatible": "with JSON",
		  }
		  ```
