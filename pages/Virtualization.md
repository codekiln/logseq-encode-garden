- # Virtualization Conceptual Overview
	- ## Overview
		- Virtualization is the creation of isolated virtual computers on one physical machine.
		- A [[Hypervisor]] allows each guest system to behave like it has dedicated hardware.
		- The goal is efficient isolation with high performance.
	- ## Context
		- Physical servers were traditionally underutilized when one workload owned one machine.
		- Virtualization improved utilization, portability, and operational control by consolidating many workloads on shared hardware.
		- It remains central in cloud infrastructure, testing environments, and local development.
	- ## Key Principles
		- **Isolation**
			- Each guest has separated memory, storage, and execution context.
		- **Hardware-assisted execution**
			- CPU virtualization extensions allow most guest instructions to run directly on host hardware.
		- **Resource scheduling**
			- CPU time, RAM, and I/O are multiplexed across guests.
		- **Encapsulation**
			- A VM can be represented as files and configuration, making migration and backup practical.
	- ## Mechanism
		- The hypervisor mediates privileged operations while exposing virtual hardware devices to guests.
		- Guest operating systems run their own kernels, unlike process-level isolation models such as [[Container]]s.
		- Virtualization is most performant when guest and host architectures match.
	- ## Examples
		- Running multiple Linux server VMs on one physical host in a data center.
		- Running an ARM64 Linux VM on Apple Silicon with hardware acceleration.
		- Using [[UTM]] with hypervisor acceleration for same-architecture guests.
	- ## Misconceptions
		- Virtualization and [[Emulation]] are identical -> **False**. Virtualization typically executes guest code on native hardware, while emulation translates different hardware behavior.
		- Virtualization only matters in cloud platforms -> **False**. It is also common in local dev, QA, security labs, and education.
		- Containers are virtual machines -> **False**. Containers share a kernel; VMs run separate kernels.
