	- [[AI Notes]]
		- The Discourse project (popular forum software) similarly merged changes to support both local devcontainers and Codespaces. They maintain a single `.devcontainer` folder but include logic and documentation for using it on Codespaces (and have blogged about making the devcontainer work smoothly on Codespaces). In their case, they use a **Compose override file** strategy: a `docker-compose.codespaces.yml` that adjusts volumes and other settings when running in Codespaces. Developers can specify this when launching a Codespace. This pattern – using alternate Compose files or override files – is another real-world solution, though as we discuss in Section 3, it has caveats.
