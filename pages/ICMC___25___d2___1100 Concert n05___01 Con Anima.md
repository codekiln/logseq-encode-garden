	  collapsed:: true
		- **Con Anima** is a musical work composed for violin and live electronics. From the perspective of structural design, the piece aims to explore and experiment with the conflicts and instability between rhythm, repetition, musical transformation, and visual illusions. It involves real-time pitch transformation and layering of sound parts based on signals captured by the microphone. The deeper objective is to seamlessly integrate the acoustic and electronic components, making them inseparable and fully unified. While the title Con Anima may at first recall the familiar musical expression marking “with lively energy” in this work it draws more explicitly from the original Italian meaning—”with soul.” This notion is reflected not only in the emotional character of the music but also in the profound interaction between the performer and the responsive electronic system. The piece in the end concludes with a quote from German philosopher [[Person/Martin Heidegger]] — “Der Tod ist die Möglichkeit der schlechthinnigen Unmöglichkeit des Daseins.”
