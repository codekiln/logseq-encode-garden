- # IMS Global aka 1EdTech aka Instructional Management Systems
	- [[My Notes]]
		- ​"IMS" in IMS Global originally stood for "Instructional Management Systems." The organization began as the Instructional Management Systems project in 1997, focusing on higher education. Over time, as its scope expanded, the acronym "IMS" was retained, even as the full phrase was de-emphasized. ​[cite](https://support.nroc.org/hc/en-us/articles/201025057-IMSCC)
