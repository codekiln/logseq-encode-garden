	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- reminds me of [[Person/Devine Lu Linvega]] with the [[Perma/Computing]] aesthetic
	- ## Summaries and Excerpts
		- two types of futuristic images available for today's people
			- "bright"
				- technology and general inventiveness would save the society from both collapse and an embarrassing change of attitude
			- "dark"
				- humankind faces profoundly horrible and hopeless times, maybe even extinction
		- collapse is probable, we ought prepare
		- The best time for building storm-tolerant life frameworks is now
		- computing will not be as ubiquitous after the collapse as it is today
			- there will be reusable material among electronic junk for at least a few decades
