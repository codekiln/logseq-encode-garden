# DONE how do I copy a python dotted reference to a class?
	- #Example
		- I can open explorer with cmd+shift+e and then enter cmd+alt+shift+c on a selected file to get `libs/sdk-py/langgraph_sdk/client.py`, but how do I get the python dotted path of  `LangGraphClient` in that file?
	- In #PyCharm and #JetBrains IDEs this is easy; select a class

		- then go to Copy / Paste Special > Copy Reference which is Opt Shift Cmd C.
	- #Answer
		- Unfortunately AFAIK there is **NO** way to do this equivalent functionality in [[VSCode]].
