- # Rich Hickey
	- ## [[Bio]]
		- Rich Hickey is an American software developer and programming language designer, best known as the creator of the Clojure programming language. He is a prominent figure in the software development community, particularly in the areas of functional programming, concurrency, and software design.
		- Hickey has worked extensively on software design and architecture, emphasizing simplicity, immutability, and the separation of concerns. His work has influenced modern software development practices, especially in the realm of functional programming and concurrent systems.
	- ## Key Contributions
		- ### #Clojure Programming Language
			- Created Clojure, a modern [[Programming/Language/Lisp]] dialect that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
			- Designed [[ClojureScript]], a Clojure compiler that targets [[JavaScript]]
			- Emphasized immutability, persistent data structures, and functional programming principles
		- ### Software Design Philosophy
			- Advocates for "Simple Made Easy" - the distinction between simple (unentangled) and easy (familiar)
			- Promotes the use of immutable data structures and pure functions
			- Emphasizes the importance of separating identity from state
		- ### Concurrency Models
			- Developed innovative approaches to concurrent programming using Software Transactional Memory (STM)
			- Created the core.async library for asynchronous programming in Clojure
	- ## Notable Talks and Presentations
		- ### "Are We There Yet?" (2009)
			- Discusses the evolution of programming languages and the need for better abstractions
			- Presented at JVM Languages Summit
		- ### [[Person/Rich Hickey/YouTube/2010/Hammock-Driven Development]] [[2010]]
			- Discusses the importance of thinking and reflection in software development
			- Emphasizes the value of stepping away from the computer to solve problems
		- ### "Simple Made Easy" (2011)
			- One of his most influential talks at Strange Loop conference
			- Explains the difference between simple and easy in software design
			- Available on YouTube and widely referenced in the software community
		- ### "The Value of Values" (2012)
			- Explores the importance of immutable values in programming
			- Presented at Strange Loop conference
	- ## Professional Background
		- Worked at various technology companies including Microsoft, Citi, and others
		- Founded Cognitect (formerly Relevance) in 2008, a software consulting company
		- Served as CTO at Cognitect until its acquisition by Nubank in 2020
		- Currently works at Nubank, a Brazilian fintech company
