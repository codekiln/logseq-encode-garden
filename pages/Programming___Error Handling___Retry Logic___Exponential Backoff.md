- # Exponential Backoff
	- A retry strategy where the delay between retry attempts increases exponentially
	- ## Key Concepts
		- Initial delay: The first waiting period after a failure
		- Multiplier/Base: The factor by which the delay increases each time (typically 2)
		- Max delay: Upper limit on how long to wait between retries
		- Max attempts: Maximum number of retry attempts before giving up
	- ## Common Use Cases
		- Network requests and API calls
		- Distributed systems communication
		- Rate limiting and throttling
		- Database connection retries
	- ## Benefits
		- Prevents overwhelming systems under stress
		- Allows temporary issues to resolve naturally
		- Reduces network congestion
		- More efficient than fixed-interval retries
	- ## Example Formula
		- delay = min(max_delay, initial_delay * (base ^ attempt_number))
		- For base=2:
			- 1st retry: 1s
			- 2nd retry: 2s
			- 3rd retry: 4s
			- 4th retry: 8s
			- etc.
