	- ## #Description
		- *Means both sanctioned and forbidden* is written for baritone saxophone, live processing and fixed media. The live processing is achieved using [[Ableton]].
		- The fixed media elements were generated through ==a series of no-input mixer improvisation sessions==, edited to create the final piece.
			- TODO *what does this mean?*
		- The title comes from [[Person/Wassily Kandinsky]]’s ==Concerning the Spiritual in Art==
			- > The artist must be blind to distinctions between “recognized” or “unrecognized” conventions of form, deaf to the transitory teaching and demands of his particular age. He must watch only the trend of the inner need, and hearken to its words alone. Then he will, with safety, employ means both sanctioned and forbidden by his contemporaries. All means are sacred which are called for by the inner need. All means are sinful which obscure that inner need.” Written for Belgian saxophonist, Floris Van der Veken, he performed the world premiere at the North American Saxophone Alliance Conference at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma on March 16, 2024.
