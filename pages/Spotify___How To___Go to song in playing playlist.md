# How to find the currently playing song in the active playlist
	- via [Click album art to go to song in playlist - The Spotify Community](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Click-album-art-to-go-to-song-in-playlist/idi-p/5941219)
		- > It used to be functionality that if you clicked on album art (in bottom left corner or in Now Playing window) it would open the current playlist showing the currently playing track. This no longer works.
		- > Please bring it back as it is really time-consuming trying to find the track in the playlist (in large playlists). I used to use this function for almost every track that played. It's really annoying it no longer works.
		  > Current functionality of clicking on album art in Now Playing takes you to the album - this is pointless as you can do that by clicking on the song title in Now Playing to do that.

		  > SOLUTION: You can jump to the song in the current playlist - click on the Playlist Name at the top of the Now Playing pane (i.e. above the album art)

		- [[2025-10-03 Fri]] This works for me, but it's really unintuitive. The Now Playing pane is at right, and the playlist name is at the top. There's a hyperlink on the name. ((68df81b8-b069-4640-a72d-60ecf806d988))
