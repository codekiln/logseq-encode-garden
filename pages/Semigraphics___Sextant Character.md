- # Sextant Character Grids from [[Unicode/Block/Symbols for Legacy Computing]]
	- Using the characters from [Symbols for Legacy Computing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbols_for_Legacy_Computing), we can render a 2x3 grid. These characters aren't on every platform. On the mac, Family name: `IBM 3270`, PostScript name: `3270-Regular` renders these.
		- The following mappings assume that we're mapping a grid that's two cells wide (A, B) and three cells tall (1, 2, 3). As a convention, we'll annotate the grids by listing the cells that are alive in alphabetical order, grouped by the number of cells in the grid that are alive.
	- There's a [[Semigraphics/Sextant Characters/Py Grid Utility]] which makes it easy to reference these using grid coordinates.
