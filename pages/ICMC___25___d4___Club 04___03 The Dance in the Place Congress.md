# The "Dance" in the Place Congress

- ## #Description
	- The “Dance” in the Place Congress. In New Orleans, a place known as Congo Square has held numerous festivals of music and dance called, “Dance in the Place Congo”. Such named events were held in the Congo nation as well. In some African countries, Ghana, e.g., there is no separate word for music – it exists only in tandem with dance.
	- This piece is intended as a parody of Insurrectionist-in-chief Donald Trump’s Big Lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him and his repeated lies and attempts to overturn the results that ultimately lead to the January 6th Insurrection at the Capital. The quotation marks around ‘Dance’ in the title refers to the fact that the attack on the Capitol was an Insurrection despite repeated attempts to “dance” around that fact by calling it merely a peaceful protest gone awry, a sight-seeing tour, a false flag operation orchestrated by Antifa, or a stop the steal rally, etc. “The Place Congress” is the Capital itself. The words/vocal sounds used in this piece are exclusively those of Donald Trump mainly taken from the speeches given the day of the attack. (A few are from prior to January 6th.)
	- The words have been subjected to many digital manipulations, including transposition, time-stretching, vocoding, granulation, shuffling, filtering of various kinds, and splitting of some words into component phonemes, e.g., to create the word “dance”. As a “tribute” to Trump’s incessant lying, bloviating, and projection, I used rap (with pop-style accompaniments) as an essential component, in addition to turning many of Trump’s despicable putdowns of others back onto himself.
	- The final portion of the piece, which follows actual recordings of the protests and rioting (with the bass in a guided improvisation “accompanying” it) reflects the sadness and grief I felt at nearly losing our Democracy that day – a danger that is now growing worse with Trump’s re-election, his unconscionable pardoning of the January 6th rioters, and his many illegal and/or unconstitutional directives as well as his blatant corruption.
	- This piece was written for my longtime friend, colleague, and stellar musician, Andrew Kohn.
