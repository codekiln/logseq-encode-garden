- # iOS App Development
	- ## Distributing iOS Apps
		- Apple's system is a "walled garden" - apps must be approved and "signed" by Apple to run on devices
		- Family Sharing only works for App Store purchases, not custom-built apps
		- ### Free Method (Impractical for Sharing)
			- Can use free Apple ID to sideload apps from Xcode to connected devices
			- **Major limitation**: Apps stop working after 7 days and must be reinstalled weekly
			- Not practical for sharing with family members
		- ### Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
			- Required for practical distribution outside App Store
			- Enables two main distribution methods:
				- #### TestFlight (Recommended)
					- Apple's official beta testing platform
					- Best option for sharing with family and friends
					- Process:
						- Enroll in Apple Developer Program
						- Upload app to App Store Connect
						- Add testers' Apple IDs (up to 10,000 testers)
						- Testers install TestFlight app from App Store
						- Receive invitation email/notification
						- App appears in TestFlight app, tap "Install"
					- **Pros**:
						- Extremely easy for testers (no technical steps)
						- Works across all devices linked to Apple ID
						- Can invite up to 10,000 testers
					- **Cons**:
						- Builds expire after 90 days - must upload new version to keep active
				- #### Ad Hoc Distribution
					- Creates app "locked" to specific devices via UDIDs
					- Process:
						- Enroll in Apple Developer Program
						- Get UDID from each device (your iPhone, iPad, wife's iPhone, wife's iPad)
						- Register UDIDs in developer account (limited to 100 devices per year)
						- Create "Ad Hoc Provisioning Profile" with UDIDs
						- Build app with that profile
						- Distribute .ipa file to install
					- **Pros**:
						- App lasts for 1 year (until developer certificate expires)
						- No 90-day expiry like TestFlight
					- **Cons**:
						- Complex setup process
						- Must rebuild and re-register if tester gets new device
						- Requires manual UDID collection and registration
	- ## Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) on iOS
		- Can make web pages act like native apps using PWA technology
		- ### Full-Screen & Home Screen Installation
			- Users can "Add to Home Screen" via Safari Share button
			- **iOS Meta Tags** (required in HTML `<head>`):
				- `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">`
					- Enables standalone mode (full-screen, no browser UI)
				- `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent">`
					- Controls status bar appearance
		- ### Web App Manifest
			- JSON file that defines app metadata and behavior
			- Link in HTML: `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">`
			- Key properties:
				- `"display": "standalone"` - Full app-like experience
				- `"name"` - App name for home screen
				- Start URL, icons (various sizes)
		- ### Service Worker (Offline Capability)
			- JavaScript file that runs in background
			- Acts as network proxy to:
				- Cache assets (HTML, CSS, images) for offline use
				- Intercept network requests
				- Serve cached content when offline
			- Requires HTTPS (secure connection)
		- ### iOS-Specific PWA Features
			- **Push Notifications**: PWAs can send push notifications (requires Service Worker)
			- **Web Share API**: Share content from web app to native iOS apps via Share Sheet
		- ### User Installation Process
			- User taps Share button (square with up arrow) in Safari
			- Selects "Add to Home Screen"
			- App icon appears on home screen
			- Tapping icon opens app in standalone mode
