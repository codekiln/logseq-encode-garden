			- separación (separation) was written for saxophonist Daniel Keintzy. The title of the work refers to the separation that exists between the live saxophone part and the materials on the [[Muisc/Fixed Media]] (notwithstanding the similarity in the materials found in both parts). This separation takes place in a very subtle manner as the performer is asked to interact in extremely controlled ways using slight variations in timbre and intonation as the basis for the interaction. As a result, separación is an extended study focusing on circular breathing and the minute control of timbre and intonation. The fixed media part for separación consists of materials which were requested by the composer and recorded by Daniel Keintzy. These materials were later processed and manipulated by the composer. The final fixed media part was created during the fall of 2000, at the Florida International University Music Technology Center. A version for English Horn was premiered by oboist Kyle Bruckmann in 2021.
