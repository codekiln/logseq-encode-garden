- in [[Person/Grégory Pakosz/GitHub/tmux]] aka [[tmux/oh-my-tmux]] the bottom status line has some  conventions for the coloring.
	- `❐ logseq  ↑ 51d 5h 14m  0 encode-logseq  1 work-logseq  2 logseq-my-tooling  3 logseq-garden`
		- ^^ in the above, `3 logseq-garden` is "faint" blue highlight with light blue text against black background, and `1 work-logseq` is "bright" blue background with which background text, indicating it's foreground.
		- AFAICT this does not mean that `3 logseq-garden` has a command that has issued a terminal bell. I think it means that in the "history order," if I were to "go back" to the prior window, it would be `3 logseq-garden`, based only on experimenting with it.
	- ## AI/Response
		- ### What the light blue tinge means
			- The "faint blue" styling is the **last window** indicator, defined by `window-status-last-style` in [[tmux]]. In [[tmux/oh-my-tmux]], the theme sets:
				- **Last window**: light blue text (`#00afff`) on gray background (`#303030`) -- the faint/subtle blue tinge
				- **Current window**: dark text (`#080808`) on light blue background (`#00afff`), bold -- the bright blue
			- This confirms the hypothesis: the faint blue marks the **most recently visited window** before the current one, not a terminal bell indicator.
		- ### Going back to the last window
			- In oh-my-tmux, `<prefix> Tab` runs `last-window`, which jumps back to the faint-blue-highlighted window. This is analogous to vim's `Ctrl-^` (`Ctrl-6`) for switching to the alternate file.
		- ### Can you go backwards multiple levels like vim's jumplist?
			- **No** -- tmux does not have a built-in window history stack. The `last-window` command only tracks **one** previous window, so `<prefix> Tab` toggles between two windows rather than walking back through a stack like vim's `Ctrl-O` / `Ctrl-I` jumplist.
			- There is no official tmux plugin that provides a full jumplist either. Possible workarounds:
				- 1. **Script your own** using the `after-select-window` tmux hook to push window indices onto a stack stored in a tmux environment variable, then bind a key to pop from that stack
				- 2. **Use `<prefix> w`** (the interactive window/session tree picker) as a quick way to jump to any window visually
				- 3. **Use `choose-tree`** which provides a searchable, navigable tree of sessions and windows
