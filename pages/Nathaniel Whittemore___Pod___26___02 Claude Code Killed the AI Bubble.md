	- ## Notes
		- For months, "AI bubble" critiques focused on hype and weak real-world utility; this episode argues that recent agentic coding adoption materially changes that thesis.
		- Framing: tools like Claude Code move AI from demo-grade output toward useful end-to-end work, changing expectations for software and information work velocity.
		- Related context from your notes on "How to Learn AI With AI":
			- learning is shifting to AI-first and agent-first, with AI as a continuous collaborator.
			- high-agency practice beats waiting for polished workflows.
			- start from vision and constraints, then iterate in public with the model.
			- maintain session handoff docs and project memory to preserve context.
	- ## Highlights
		- OpenAI "agent-first" push (as captured in your related highlight): by March 31, for technical tasks, interacting with an agent is intended to become the default first resort over an editor or terminal.
		- Practical takeaway: competitive risk may come less from overestimating AI and more from underestimating the speed of workflow transition to agent-mediated execution.
		- Cross-episode synthesis:
			- "Claude Code Killed the AI Bubble" gives the macro adoption/economics framing.
			- "How to Learn AI With AI" gives the operator behavior needed to benefit from that shift.
