		- [[chezmoi/Comparison Table]] makes it look cool
		- > "I just use [[Nix/OS]] and now my entire system is reproducible. Dotfiles are haphazard and dotfiles managers are a bandaid. NixOS is the only true declarative development environment"
		- > "My entire [[CLI]] setup is [[Container/iz/ed]], So as long as i have access to a container runtime environment like [[Docker]]/[[Podman]], By just running the container i will have access to all my tools without the need to setup, and if anything goes wrong i can just thrash my current environment and re-launch ðŸ¤¯"
		- > "check out [[Dev Containers]], they provide a framework for this. I can spin up a container for any repo and my dotfiles are automatically installed from GitHub, alongside language-specific tooling"
