- # Play, Curiosity, and Collaboration: Live Coding in Audio Programming Education
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- They use [[SuperCollider]] but she teaches with [[TidalCycles]] and [[SonicPi]]
		- students are mostly audio production students
		- one of the questions was from [[Person/Visda Goudarzi]] about live coding for people with traditional engineering background
	- ## Description
		- Live coding has emerged as an innovative and playful method for teaching audio programming, particularly for students in audio and music technology. By enabling instructors to demonstrate code in real-time, live coding bridges the gap between abstract programming concepts and their tangible impact on sound and music. This approach not only fosters curiosity but also sparks innovation by encouraging students to experiment freely with sound synthesis and explore algorithmic composition in a low pressure, exploratory environment. The inherently interactive and improvisational nature of live coding allows students to directly observe the creative process, inspiring a sense of play as they manipulate code to generate unexpected outcomes. This paper examines the implementation of live coding in an undergraduate audio programming course, highlighting how it facilitates hands on learning, cultivates creativity, and promotes collaborative problem-solving. Through activities designed to encourage experimentation and discovery, students engage deeply with both technical and artistic aspects of programming. The discussion also explores the challenges encountered over multiple semesters, offering insights into how playful engagement, curiosity, and a focus on innovation can transform the learning experience in audio programming education.

			- **Visda Goudarzi**Â is a computer musician and researcher working at the intersection of sound and human-computer interaction. Her work explores sound and music computing, live coding, data sonification, sound synthesis, and the use of new media in artistic practice. She creates and performs with interactive, participatory sonic interfaces, and her creative output includes live electronic performances, live coding, and data-driven sound works. Visda is an Associate Professor and the Director of the Music Technology Program in the School of Audio and Music at Columbia College Chicago.
