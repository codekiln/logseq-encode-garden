	- ## #Description
		- The Disappearing Bell is a pure electronic music work presented in fixed media sound format, inspired by and sourced from natural ambient sounds including temple bells, hunting grounds, avalanche rumblings, and the rustle of falling leaves. The piece is an exploration of the intersection between natural and electronic music through meticulous processing and creative manipulation of sound fragments. In the realm of electronic music technology, the creators skillfully employed a variety of advanced audio processing techniques in accordance with the inherent properties of the sound materials and their expressive artistic needs. These techniques include granular synthesis, subtractive synthesis, resampling, spectral morphing, and pitch shifting. The organic integration of these techniques not only enriches the spectral forms of the audio materials but also embodies the composers’ pursuit of a profound aesthetic concept within musical language. The narrative of “The Disappearing Bell” is centered around the thematic search for a bell sound. Sound fragments, like hidden clues, are ingenely woven into the temporal flow of the piece. From fragmentation to reassembly, from concrete to abstract, these fragmented sounds, interacting with different soundscape scenarios, collectively craft a vibrant journey of sound “hunting.” This narrative traverses the intertwined realms of time and space, capturing the spontaneity of nature while provoking a reflection on the imagistic essence of sound.
