- A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is when an attacker secretly positions themselves between two parties and intercepts their communication.
- Conceptually, it breaks trust in the channel rather than necessarily breaking the app itself.
- Common outcomes include eavesdropping, message tampering, credential theft, or session hijacking when integrity and authenticity checks are weak or absent.
