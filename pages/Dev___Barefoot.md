- # Barefoot Developer
	- A term coined by [[Person/Maggie Appleton]] to describe a new kind of developer who creates [[Dev/Home-Cooked Software]] for local communities rather than building software for the masses at industrial scale
	- ## Definition
		- Barefoot developers build software for themselves, their family and friends, their neighborhood, and their community
		- They solve local problems for local people
		- They don't need the complexity of professional industrial software - most local community software needs can be solved with simple CRUD apps, basic user authentication, and a few API calls
		- They don't need to scale to millions of people, juggle conflicting user needs, or ship features quickly for venture capitalists
	- ## Characteristics
		- Build software with care and love for people they know
		- Solve specific, local problems rather than generic ones
		- Create tools that are private and secure by default (no selling data)
		- Maintain control over their software and data
		- Don't have financial pressure to monetize or make profit
		- Work at small scale (dozens or hundreds of users, not thousands or millions)
	- ## Growth and Tools
		- Expected to grow exponentially more than professional developers
		- Need language model agents that act as central orchestrators to guide them through building software
		- Require tools accessible via plain English prompts rather than technical knowledge
		- Need "glue" between language model capabilities to build working applications
