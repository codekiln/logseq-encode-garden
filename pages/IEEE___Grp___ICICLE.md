- # International Consortium for Innovation and Collaboration in [[Learning Engineering]] (ICICLE)
	- ![Learning Engineering at a glance](https://sagroups.ieee.org/icicle/wp-content/uploads/sites/148/2023/01/LE-infographic.png)
	- ## ðŸŒ± What is Learning Engineering?
		- Learning engineering is a **process** and **interdisciplinary practice** that:
			- Applies the **learning sciences**
			- Uses **human-centered engineering design**
			- Relies on **data-informed decision-making**
			- to support learners and their development
	- ## ðŸ”„ The Learning Engineering Process
		- ![Learning Engineering Process Diagram](../assets/images/learning-engineering-process.jpg)
		- The process consists of:
			- 1. **Challenge Definition**: Identifying learner needs and context.
			- 2. **Creation**: Designing interventions, tools, or content.
			- 3. **Implementation**: Deploying the learning solution.
			- 4. **Investigation**: Analyzing learner interactions and outcomes using data.
			- 5. **Iteration**: Refining solutions based on insights.
	- ## ðŸ§  Core Disciplines
		- Learning engineering integrates insights and methods from:
			- Cognitive psychology
			- Developmental psychology
			- Social psychology
			- Neuroscience
			- Education research
			- Learning sciences
			- Data science
			- Biomedical R&D
			- Motivational science
			- Anthropology
	- ## ðŸ§° Engineering Mindsets and Concepts
		- **Constraints** shape problem-solving and are central to engineering
		- Engineers work with **modular systems**, where parts interact
		- Effective systems involve **feedback loops** between inputs and performance
		- **Multiple feedback loops** inform course correction and design iteration
		- Engineering often involves **design under uncertainty** and **rapid prototyping**
	- ## ðŸ“ˆ Data Instrumentation and Analytics
		- Learning engineering emphasizes **data collection**, **modeling**, and **analytics** as part of design.
		- Systems are **instrumented** to collect learning activity and performance data.
		- Data is used to refine both the content and the learning pathway over time.
		- A common analytic used is **learning curve analysis**, which shows how error rates decrease over time as learners acquire mastery.
	- ## ðŸ‘¤ Human-Centered Design in Learning
		- Human-centered design is key to learning engineering:
			- Designs are developed using **personas** (e.g., "Lily, a 5-year-old learner")
			- Empathizes with learners' needs, contexts, and abilities
			- Encourages inclusive, equitable learning experiences
	- ## ðŸª´ Role of ICICLE
		- [[IEEE/Grp/ICICLE]] serves to:
			- Advance professional development for learning engineers
			- Build shared language and standards in the field
			- Facilitate collaboration between academia, industry, and government
			- Support tools like the **Learning Engineering Toolkit**
