			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 0}} Introduction to AI Coding Tool Selection
				- Key challenges in the current AI landscape:
					- Abundance of options and competition
					- Rapid changes in tool effectiveness
					- Example: Llama 4's Maverick and Scout models becoming obsolete quickly
				- Need for a framework to make informed decisions
					- Focus on investing time effectively
					- "10,000 informed iterations" vs "10,000 hours"
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 74}} The Compute Advantage Framework - [[Person/IndyDevDan/Compute Advantage/Equation]]
				- #### Core Concept
					- Higher compute advantage = More value produced as an engineer
					- Essential for managing results in 2025 and beyond
				- #### Framework Components
					- Simple equation with two parts:
						- Numerator (factors to increase)
						- Denominator (factors to decrease)
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 126}} Understanding the Variables
				- #### Compute Scaling
					- Definition: Raw intelligence and scaling methods
					- Examples:
						- Prompt chains
						- Agentic loops
						- Multiple LLM calls
				- #### Autonomy
					- Definition: Tool's ability to work independently
					- Impact on compute advantage
					- Example comparison: Aider vs Claude Code
				- #### Cost Variables (Denominator)
					- Time: Duration required for tasks
					- Effort: Cognitive load and keystrokes
					- Monetary Costs: Financial investment required
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 319}} Tool Analysis Using the Framework
				- #### Aider Analysis
					- Compute Scaling: 25 (bare metal implementation)
					- Autonomy: 5 (limited autonomous capabilities)
					- Time: 25 (efficient at preventing manual coding)
					- Effort: 50 (requires more user interaction)
					- Monetary Cost: 10 (open-source advantage)
				- #### Cursor Analysis
					- Compute Scaling: 40 (embedded agent capabilities)
					- Autonomy: 25 (improved autonomous features)
					- Time: Reduced from Aider
					- Effort: Lower than Aider
					- Monetary Cost: 30 (subscription model)
				- #### Claude Code Analysis
					- Compute Scaling: 50 (Claude 3.7 Sonnet integration)
					- Autonomy: 40 (advanced agentic capabilities)
					- Time: 10 (significant reduction in shipping time)
					- Effort: Reduced significantly
					- Monetary Cost: 70 (high token usage)
				- #### Devon Analysis
					- Compute Scaling: Highest (advanced agentic architecture)
					- Autonomy: 70 (superior autonomous capabilities)
					- Time: 5 (minimal user time required)
					- Effort: Significantly reduced
					- Monetary Cost: 75 ($500/month)
