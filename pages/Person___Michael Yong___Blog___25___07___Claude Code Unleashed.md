	- [[My Notes]]
		- [[2025-07-18 Fri]]
			- [[Person/Michael Yong]] really Gets It when it comes to the future of coding.
			- These are his lessons learned building [[Background Agents]] while trying to make [[Claude Code/Tool/Claude Code Terragon]]
			- ## [[Cost Savings]]
				- I didn't realize that one could get savings from [[Anthropic/Product/Claude/Max/20x]] vs [[Anthropic/Product/Claude]] individually billed.
					- ![Claude Usage estimation](https://ymichael.com/static/img/blog/claude-code-usage.png)
				- [[Key Insight]]
					- > I highly recommend getting a claude max subscription. **Not having to worry about** rate limits, per-use cost, **whether you should use sonnet or opus** is truly a game changer. With Max, I stopped thinking in terms of "is this a task that's good for claude code? Is this a task for sonnet or opus?" Instead, it became **"How can I offload more work to claude code?" That mental shift alone was worth the price**. - #Quote from [[Person/Michael Yong]]
						- reminds me of IndyDevDan's Compute Advantage equation and ideas

			- [[Anthropic/AI/App/Claude Code]] and [[Git Worktrees]]
				- he says it's a pain, and I imagine it is
					- > You can't help but feel like you're constantly juggling:
					  * What was I doing?
					  * Which branch am I on?
					  * Which tab was this again?
					  * What was the context of this change?
					  * Which IDE window corresponds to this worktree?
				- This is the inspiration for the thing he's building, [[Claude Code/Tool/Claude Code Terragon]]
					- #Goals
						- > In the past week, I've averaged ~30 tasks running on terragon a day. Locally, I'm often testing and finishing up a task that was started by a background agent.

			- #Learned
				- [[AI/Coding/Idea/25/07/Tools for Context Switching]]
					- In time, I imagine that we will develop assistive technologies specifically to aid us with context switching in a concurrent workstream world!
					- > Managing multiple agents requires a lot of context switching. This isn't normal! You're suddenly tracking 10+ concurrent work streams instead of 1-2. But you get to do a lot more things in a shorter amount of time. -- #Quote from [[Person/Michael Yong]]
			- [[AI/Coding/Problem/Task Decomposition]]
				- > Using [[Claude Code/Tool/Claude Code Terragon]] has fundamentally changed how I think about breaking down work. I'm creating smaller, more agent-friendly tasks. #Quote from [[Person/Michael Yong]]
