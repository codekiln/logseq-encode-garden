alias:: [[Greenfield Coding]]

- Greenfield coding refers to
	- **the development of a new software application or system from scratch**
	- **without any constraints imposed by prior work**
- The term implies **starting with a "clean slate,"**
	- allowing developers to create solutions **based on the latest technologies and methodologies** without needing to accommodate or work around legacy systems
- **History of the Term:**
	- The term "greenfield" originates from **urban planning and real estate**, where it describes **undeveloped land (often agricultural) that has not been previously built upon**.In technology and software development, it gained popularity in the late 20th century as a metaphor for projects that start anew. **This contrasts with "brownfield" projects** ([[Programming/Legacy Codebase]]), which involve modifying or integrating with existing systems. The distinction has become essential in discussions of software development practices, particularly in agile methodologies and cloud computing, where the ability to innovate without legacy constraints can lead to more efficient and effective solutions.
