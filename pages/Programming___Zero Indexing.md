- # [Zero-Based Indexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering)
	- Also known as: zero indexing, zero-based numbering
	- A fundamental concept in computer science and programming where the first element of a sequence (array, list, tuple, etc.) is assigned the index 0, the second element the index 1, and so on
	- ## Overview
		- The first element is at index 0
		- The second element is at index 1
		- The nth element is at index n-1
		- Contrasts with one-based indexing, where the first element is assigned the index 1
	- ## Rationale
		- ### Memory Address Calculation
			- An array's name refers to the address of its first element
			- The index represents an offset from this base address
			- In C, the expression `array[i]` is equivalent to `*(array + i)`
			- The element at index `i` is located at the memory address `array` plus `i` times the size of each element
			- Starting the index at 0 simplifies this calculation, as the first element is at the base address with an offset of zero
		- ### Simplified Range Calculations
			- When defining ranges or performing calculations involving indices, zero-based indexing often leads to cleaner expressions
			- The length of a sequence can be directly used as the upper bound in loops without additional adjustments
			- Example: A loop from 0 to length-1 is more straightforward than from 1 to length
	- ## Advantages
		- **Simplified Calculations**: Cleaner and more intuitive expressions for ranges and loops
		- **Alignment with Memory Addressing**: Aligns with the way memory addresses are computed, leading to more efficient pointer arithmetic
		- **Widespread Adoption**: Used by most modern programming languages
	- ## Programming Languages Using Zero-Based Indexing
		- C
		- C++
		- Java
		- Python
		- JavaScript
		- Go
		- Swift
		- Kotlin
		- Rust
	- ## Contrast with One-Based Indexing
		- Some languages, particularly those used in scientific computing, prefer one-based indexing to align with traditional mathematical notation
		- Examples:
			- Fortran
			- MATLAB
			- R
		- In these languages, the first element of a sequence is accessed with index 1
		- Can be more intuitive for users familiar with mathematical conventions
	- ## Examples
		- ### Zero-Based (Most Languages)
			- First element: `array[0]`
			- Second element: `array[1]`
			- Last element of n-length array: `array[n-1]`
		- ### One-Based (Some Languages)
			- First element: `array[1]`
			- Second element: `array[2]`
			- Last element of n-length array: `array[n]`
