# Prototyping Digital Musical Instruments in [[Reality/Virtual]]
	- **Session Type:** Full Paper
	- **Presenters:**
		- *Anıl Çamcı* — Associate Professor, [[Uni/Michigan]] (Performing Arts Technology)
		- *John Granzow* — Associate Professor, [[Uni/Michigan]] (School of Music, Theatre & Dance)
	- ### **Core Idea**
		- Designing Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) is often slow and expensive due to iterative needs for form, sound, and interaction. This research introduces a VR-based workflow that enables **rapid prototyping of DMIs**, allowing creators to test functionality before committing to fabrication.
	- ### Workflow components
		- | System Component | Tool / Framework |
		  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
		  | **3D Modeling** | [[TinkerCad]] |
		  | **Audio Programming** | [[PureData]] (via LibPd) |
		  | **Game Engine** | [[Unity]] |
		  | **Procedural Audio** | LibPd Integration for Unity |
		  | **Spatial Audio** | Steam Audio |
		  | **VR Headset** | [[Co/Meta/Quest]] |
		- Real-time interaction with game objects.
		- PureData procedural audio streamed into Unity.
		- Spatial audio enables realistic sound environments.
		- Meta Quest provides motion input and immersive feedback.
	- ### **Workshop Summary**
		- A hands-on workshop followed the presentation. Participants used the VR system to:
		- Learn the end-to-end DMI prototyping workflow.
		- Collaboratively develop and test original concepts.
		- Evaluate interactivity, audio, and form virtually before fabrication.
	- ### **Participant Prototypes**
		- Each design explores form–function relationships within an audio-visual context. These were developed using the described VR-integrated system:
		- **"Chimney House DMI"**
			- A sonic instrument experienced through a house-shaped object.
			- Sound perceived as if emerging from a chimney.
		- **"Top in a Bowl"**
			- A spinning top meant to be used within a concave container.
			- Interaction defined by spatial constraints.
		- **"Free-Spin Top"**
			- Similar form factor to prototype 2, but meant to be spun in open space.
			- Focuses on movement in unrestricted VR environments.
		- **"Preset Block DMI"**
			- A physical-style preset selector for an IMU-based instrument.
			- Emulates tactile switching of modes/configurations.
