- # [This Is a Time of Technical Deflation](https://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2025/12/this-is-a-time-of-technical-deflation/)
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- Dan frames modern AI-assisted development as a deflationary force on software implementation cost.
		- The "refinancing your codebase mortgage at a lower rate" analogy captures the practical upside: lower marginal cost to change and ship software.
		- The argument extends to roadmap strategy: take on debt to move faster now, then pay it down later when remediation is cheaper.
		- This perspective aligns with the case for faster iteration, but it also heightens the need for verification and guardrails.
	- ## Highlights
		- "Day over day, year over year, AI is driving down the cost of writing code. Economists have a word for what happens when stuff keeps getting cheaper: deflation. And you do things differently during deflation."
		- "But what is a ‘trap’ for a nation is a miracle for a codebase. Usually, deflation is bad for debtors because money becomes harder to come by. But technical debt is different: you don’t owe money, you owe work. And the cost of work is what’s deflating."
		- "The cost to pay off your debt – the literal dollars and hours required to fix the mess – is diminishing. It is cheaper to clean up your code today than it has ever been."
		- "This leads to a surprising conclusion for anyone managing a roadmap. You should be willing to take on more technical debt than you ever would have before. Ship the prototype. Skip the elegant abstraction. You are borrowing expensive human hours today, and you will get to pay them back with cheap AI hours tomorrow."
		- "Daniel draws the analogy to “refinancing your codebase mortgage at a lower rate”"
		- "In this new world, procrastination reduces the price of perfection. Adjust your spending accordingly."
