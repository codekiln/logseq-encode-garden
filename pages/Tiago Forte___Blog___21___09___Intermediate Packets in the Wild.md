	- One of the most powerful shifts I see people make in the way they work is breaking down their large projects or goals into smaller chunks, which I call “Intermediate Packets.”
		- If you design a slide that elegantly communicates a certain idea, why not keep it as a building block that can be reused in multiple slide decks in the future?
		- If you write a paragraph that powerfully argues a point, why not save that paragraph and incorporate it anytime you need to make that particular point?
		- If you create a diagram that effectively illustrates a trend in your industry, why not preserve that diagram so you always have evidence to support your assertions?
		- If you find a quote that speaks to one of your deeply held values, why not put it somewhere that you can refer to anytime you’re feeling down or discouraged?
	- instead of finding a separate place for each of these kinds of content and many dozens of others, keep them all in your system of personal knowledge, which I call a [[Second Brain]].
	- I’ve collected many examples of how this concept is applied in different creative media and different professions
