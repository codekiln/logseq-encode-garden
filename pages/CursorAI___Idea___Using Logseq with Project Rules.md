- # Using [[Logseq]] with [[CursorAI/Project Rules]]
	- If one keeps a [[Knowledge Garden]] filled with all technical knowledge that cursor needs to know about, it may make sense to symlink that into a each repository and to make it available to [[CursorAI Agent Mode]] to draw upon. [[CursorAI/Project Rules]] could then even be written that reference a well-known spot where the documentation is stored, so the same information could be utilized across projects.
