alias:: [[Proprio-Perceptive]]

- In **Jean Piaget’s** work, **proprio-perceptive** refers to perception that arises **from the body itself**, not from external objects.
	- **Proprio-** → information coming from muscles, joints, posture, balance, and movement
	- **Perceptive** → the act of perceiving or organizing sensory information
- So **proprio-perceptive perception** is **the child’s awareness of their own bodily actions and internal sensations**—how it feels to move, grasp, suck, turn the head, maintain balance, etc.
