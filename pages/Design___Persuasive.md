- Persuasive Design
	- **Persuasive design** = UI/UX and product patterns intentionally designed to **influence user behavior** (e.g., motivate, guide, increase conversions, encourage habits). It sits on a spectrum from **ethical guidance** to manipulation. ([Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/topic/persuasive-design/))
	- **Short history + adjacency to [[UX/Pattern/Dark]]:**
		- **[[1/9/9/0/s]]–[[2/0/0/0/s]] (academic framing):** [[Person/B. J. Fogg]] formalized **"persuasive technology"** (often called "captology") as interactive computing designed to change attitudes/behaviors via persuasion and social influence, and his work became a key foundation for modern "persuasive design" thinking in tech products. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasive_technology))
		- **[[2/0/0/3]] (UX mainstreaming):** Nielsen Norman Group was already discussing "persuasive design" in the context of web persuasion and captology-era ideas, signaling its uptake into practical UX and product design discourse. ([Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persuasive-design-new-captology-book/))
		- **[[2/0/1/0]] (the ethical boundary gets named):** UX designer [[Person/Harry Brignull]] coined **[[UX/Pattern/Dark]]** (via darkpatterns.org) to label interface designs that trick people into actions they wouldn't otherwise choose with full understanding. ([Medium](https://harrybr.medium.com/bringing-dark-patterns-to-light-d86f24224ebf))
		- **[[2/0/1/0/s]]–present (research + governance lens):** [[UX/Pattern/Dark]] became a major topic in HCI research and policy discussions, increasingly framed as **deceptive choice architecture**—often using the same behavioral levers as persuasive design, but aimed at outcomes that primarily benefit the business over the user.
