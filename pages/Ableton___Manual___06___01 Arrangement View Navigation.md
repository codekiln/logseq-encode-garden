	- ![navigation of ableton arrangement view](https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/11/ArrangerNavigationWithBreakouts.png?auto=&w=1533)
		- ## 1 - Zooming left and right with [[Ableton/Arrangement View/Beat Time Ruler]]
			- > To smoothly change the zoom level, click and drag vertically in the beat-time ruler at the top of the Arrangement View (you can also drag horizontally to scroll the display). The Arrangement View can also be zoomed using a pinch gesture on a supported trackpad or touch screen.
		- ## 2 - Zooming into [[Ableton/Selection]] in [[Ableton/Arrangement View/Track/Display Area]] *Progressively*
			- > To zoom in and out around the current selection progressively, you can use the computer keyboard’s + and - keys, or scroll with the mousewheel or trackpad while holding the Ctrl (Win) / Cmd (Mac) modifier. To “pan“ the display, click and drag while holding the CtrlAlt (Win) / CmdOption (Mac) modifier. Double-clicking in the beat-time ruler also zooms to the current selection. If nothing is selected, double-clicking the beat-time ruler zooms out to show the entire Arrangement.
			- [[My Notes]]
				- ### [[Ableton/Menu/View/Zoom/In or Out]] to zoom in or out (left to right)
					- [[Keyshort]] `+` or `-`
						- [[My Note]]: these are actually `-` or `=` keys, respectively; it doesn't matter if you press `Shift` or not
							- `Cmd`+mouse wheel: zoom left/right like the above
				- ### Pan left right up down around selection in Arrangement View #card
					- [[Keyshort]] use `Cmd+Opt` while clicking and dragging a selection to pan up, down, left, right
		- ## 3 - Zooming into [[Ableton/Selection]] in [[Ableton/Arrangement View/Track/Display Area]] *Completely*
			- > To zoom in the current selection completely, press Z or use the View menu’s Zoom to Arrangement Time Selection command. Note that if you select time on a single Arrangement clip, the [Clip Content Editor in Clip View](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/11/clip-view/#zooming-and-scrolling) will zoom in on that selected time. You can revert back to the previous zoom state by pressing the X key. Note that when zooming in multiple times using the Z key, the X key can be pressed multiple times to go back one step each time the key is pressed.
			- [[My Notes]]
				- ### To Zoom in to selection completely
					- Press `Z` to zoom to to selection horizontally and then vertically; [[Ableton/Menu/View/Zoom/Arrangement Time Selection/To]]
