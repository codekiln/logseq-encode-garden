# Preferences for Source Code Management (SCM)
	- use git
	- ## Git preferences
		- each commit should group files into a single logical change to the codebase
	- ## Commit Message Preferences
		- 1 - use [[Conventional Commits]] as a standard for the commit messages (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
			- Recommendation: download the conventional commits specification and put it at `docs/dev/scm/convention_commits.md`
		- 2 - commit style - use [[gitmoji]] (https://gitmoji.dev/) to communicate what's happening at this point in the project
		- 3 - the last line(s) of the commit should (each) be referencs to the ID and Name of the task being worked on with respect to the task storage system of record
