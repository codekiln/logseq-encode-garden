	- ## #Description
		- This piece is a transformation of a duo for flute and piano named “El reino del rêve” , a pun mixing spanish and French that plays with the name of a song “The Kingdom of the Upside Down” and the “The Kingdom of dreams”
		- The continuous transformation of a set of gestures, rewritten again and again obsessively and projected in the composition of the tape part, that avoids any sampled sound, were part of a process in which the polarities between sound forms seemed to be irreductible.
		- The piece is torn in one side by the exploration of the instrumental energetic modalities, in the other side the search for a ==goal oriented syntax and the need of the use harmonic to organize== the musical space.
		- **Esquisse-o-phrenia** was premiered in Buenos Aires by Alkünoir duo and played around the world and recorded by Proyecto Laberinto ( Andrea Escobar and Rodrigo Evangelista) for Elektramusic Label.
