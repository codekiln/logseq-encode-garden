- # Headless Browser Explanation
	- ## Overview
		- A **headless browser** is a web browser without a graphical user interface (GUI), allowing automated control via code for tasks such as rendering, scraping, and testing.
	- ## Context
		- Traditional browsers like Chrome and Firefox are designed for human interaction, but automated systems—such as web scrapers, test suites, and bots—often need to interact with webpages without displaying them. Headless browsers provide this functionality programmatically.
	- ## Key Principles
		- **No GUI** – Runs in the background without rendering to a screen.
		- **Automatable** – Controlled via code (e.g., JavaScript or Python APIs).
		- **DOM Interaction** – Can load, manipulate, and query HTML just like a full browser.
	- ## Mechanism
		- A headless browser behaves like a regular browser: it parses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, builds the DOM, executes scripts, and even renders pages (off-screen). Since no GUI is needed, it consumes fewer resources and runs faster.
		- Developers use headless browsers by scripting commands like "go to this URL," "click this button," or "extract this content" using automation libraries or testing frameworks.
	- ## Examples
		- ### According to [[Mermaid/DeepWiki]], Mermaid renders images in [[Playwright]]
			-
		- ### Using [[Playwright]] to navigate and extract text
			- ~~~python
			  # Using Playwright to navigate and extract text
			  from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
			  
			  with sync_playwright() as p:
			      browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
			      page = browser.new_page()
			      page.goto("https://example.com")
			      title = page.title()
			      print(title)
			      browser.close()
			  ~~~
	- ## Applications
		- **Web scraping** – Extract data from dynamic websites that require JavaScript execution.
		- **Automated testing** – Run integration and end-to-end tests (e.g. using Selenium or Playwright) without launching a visible browser.
		- **SEO rendering** – Pre-render content for crawlers when building Single Page Applications (SPAs).
		- **Monitoring and screenshots** – Capture visual changes or regressions in pages.
		- **Bot simulation** – Mimic real user interactions for load testing or AI training.
	- ## Misconceptions
		- *"Headless means limited"* → False. Headless browsers support the full browser engine minus the GUI.
		- *"They're only for scraping"* → False. They're widely used for testing, monitoring, and rendering.
