	- ## #Description
		- ### Short
			- Inspired by the Japanese post-war art movement; contact-miked piano frame drives feedback into four corner loudspeakers while transducers excite the soundboard with processed harmonics.
		- ### Long
			- Gutai is a piece written as an exercise in self listening for the performer and an immersive listening experience for the audience.
			- **the performer reads a graphic score**, and **sculpts an improvisation** through it.
			- Every musical choice has potential to come back later through electronics.
			- responsibility of the performer to always be listening and to respond to the decisions they made previously in the performance. Simultaneously, these captured bits of the improvisation will be played back by the speakers surrounding the audience, giving them an inside look at the creation of the improvisation and surrounding them with the pianist’s choices. The hope is that with each performance, the player will be able to understand themselves as an improvisor through coming to terms with the consequences of their own musical decisions and that the listeners can experience the creation of the work.

			- **Austin Engelhardt** is a composer and improviser whose work is dedicated to challenging and reshaping communication through music. Raised in rural Kansas, Austin came to the musical world later in life, only learning to read music at the age of 20. This late start did not hinder his passion; instead, it fueled a relentless ambition to redefine and expand musical notation. His artistic vision, deeply influenced by the aesthetic nature of sound, draws inspiration from the abstract. Austin earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Missouri – Kansas City and a master’s degree from The [[School/New England Conservatory]]. He has studied under esteemed teachers including John Mallia, Chen Yi, Zhou Long, Paul Rudy, Yotam Haber, and Michael Miller.
