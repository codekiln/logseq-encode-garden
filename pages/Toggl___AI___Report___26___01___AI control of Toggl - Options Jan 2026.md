  - ## CLI Tools for Toggl Track
    - ### Toggl CLI (Python) – Unofficial CLI & Python SDK Wrapper
      - **Description:** A popular command-line tool maintained by Adam Uhlir (originally by D.R. Adams) that uses Toggl Track's API. It also provides a Python library (ORM-like wrappers) for scripting[^1]. You can start and stop timers, list and edit entries, and delete entries via the CLI. For example, `toggl start` begins a new time entry, `toggl now` shows or edits the current running entry, and `toggl stop` stops it[^2]. Projects can be listed (`toggl projects ls`) and edited through the Python API (e.g. changing a project name and saving it)[^2], though the CLI interface itself focuses on time entry actions. Full CRUD on time entries is supported (including creating, updating, and deleting entries).
      - **Projects/Clients:** The tool can list projects and allows editing via its Python API wrappers (it treats projects, clients, tags, etc., as objects you can fetch and modify in code)[^1]. However, there may not be a direct CLI subcommand to create a new project or client – those would be done via the Python library or web interface. It's primarily time-tracking-centric on the CLI.
      - **Reports:** Toggl CLI (Python) does not generate report summaries itself. It can retrieve time entry data (e.g. you could script a summary by fetching entries), but there's no built-in reporting command.
      - **Usability & Notes:** This tool is open source (MIT licensed)[^17] and quite mature, with frequent updates (supports Toggl API v9). It runs on any Python-supporting platform. On first use it creates a `~/.togglrc` config and can store your API token or credentials for convenience. Caveat: The CLI is Unix-oriented (automated config setup isn't as smooth on Windows, requiring manual config edits)[^2]. Overall, Toggl CLI (Python) is a robust choice for full time entry CRUD with the bonus of a scriptable Python API[^1].
    - ### Toggl CLI (Node.js) – Unofficial Node CLI
      - **Description:** A Node.js-based CLI tool (by Beau Raines) inspired by the above Python project. It was updated to use the Toggl Track API v9[^3]. This CLI supports starting and stopping time entries, continuing existing entries, and editing the running entry. Notably, it also supports adding manual entries (with specified start and stop times) and deleting entries by ID – features contributed by the community[^3]. It provides interactive prompts for some commands and configuration.
      - **Projects/Clients:** This tool can assign a time entry to a project (you can specify project by name or ID when starting an entry) and likewise assign a client via project selection, but it does not manage project or client objects itself (no commands to list or create projects/clients)[^3]. You'd need to create projects/clients in Toggl Track first, then use their names/IDs in the CLI for time entries. The config file supports setting a default workspace and project, and you can also specify a client name when starting an entry which helps select the project[^3] (it doesn't create new clients, just filters projects by client name).
      - **Reports:** This CLI provides simple built-in reports. It can show a breakdown of today's tracked time by project, and a week summary (by project per day) – essentially quick summaries in the console[^3]. This is helpful for quick insights, though for detailed reporting or date ranges beyond the current week you'd use Toggl's reports API or web UI.
      - **Usability & Notes:** This tool is also open source (MIT). It's distributed via npm as `@beauraines/toggl-cli`, so you can install it with `npm i -g @beauraines/toggl-cli`. It takes a similar approach to the Python CLI in syntax (for familiarity). One caveat is that, as with many third-party tools, you'll need to store your API token (in a config file or env variables) to authenticate. It's a solid choice if you prefer a Node/JavaScript stack or want those quick report commands in your CLI.
    - ### Toggl CLI (Rust) – Unofficial Rust CLI
      - **Description:** A command-line tool written in Rust (by Watercooler Labs) for Toggl Track[^7]. It uses the official API v9 under the hood and compiles to a single binary for speed and easy installation. It supports the fundamental time entry actions: starting a new entry, stopping the running entry, showing the current entry, listing recent entries, etc. For example, you can run `toggl start "Task description" -p ProjectName` to start a timer, `toggl stop` to stop it, and `toggl list -n 5` to list your last 5 entries[^8]. The CLI is designed for efficiency, including features like an interactive project picker (with `--fzf` flag for fuzzy finding projects).
      - **Projects/Clients:** Currently, this Rust CLI is focused on time entries and does not have commands to create or manage projects or clients. You can reference projects by name when starting an entry (as noted above), and it will map that to a project ID, but you can't create new projects or list projects via this CLI yet. Project and client management would still be done via Toggl's web or another tool.
      - **Reports:** There are no built-in reporting commands in the Rust CLI. Its scope is limited to tracking and querying time entries (active or recent). For reports, you would use Toggl's official reporting tools or APIs.
      - **Usability & Notes:** Being written in Rust, the CLI is very fast and can be installed via Cargo (`cargo install toggl`) or via pre-built binaries (it's available in Homebrew and Arch Linux's AUR as `toggl-cli` as well)[^7]. It stores the API token securely using your OS keychain by default[^7]. As of version 0.4.x, one limitation is the lack of a direct delete command for entries – if you need to delete an entry, you'd currently have to use another method (though you could stop an entry and edit it). This project is active, so features like deletion might be added in the future. Overall, it's a convenient open-source option if you prefer a compiled tool and command-line speed.
    - ### Other CLI Tools
      - Aside from the above, there are a few more niche CLI utilities (open-source) for Toggl Track, though with narrower scope or older API versions. For example, `toggl-hammer` is a Python CLI to quickly add "hour blocks" of time for past dates (useful for back-filling time, but it doesn't let you specify custom start/stop times or descriptions)[^18]. It's designed for "lazy" input of fixed-length entries and is not a general-purpose CLI for full CRUD. There are also older CLI projects like `joequery/Toggl-CLI` and community scripts, but many were built against the now-deprecated API v8. The Toggl Track engineering team maintains a list of third-party tools, and many CLI projects have been updated or forked to work with API v9[^18][^19]. When choosing a CLI, ensure it supports API v9, as the older v8 endpoints are no longer available. The three CLI options above (Python, Node, Rust) are among the best-maintained for Toggl Track with API v9 support and cover a range of language ecosystems. All are open source, allowing you to inspect or modify the code if needed.
  - ## MCP Interfaces for Toggl Track
    - Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a newer approach that allows AI or natural-language-driven clients (like ChatGPT plugins or Claude AI) to interact with services through a standardized interface. In the Toggl Track context, MCP servers act as an adapter on top of the Toggl API to interpret high-level commands (often in natural language) into Toggl actions. This can be useful if you want to control Toggl via conversational AI or integrate it into an AI agent workflow. Two notable MCP implementations exist for Toggl Track:
    - ### Toggl MCP Server (Node) – by Louis Beaumont
      - **Description:** This is an unofficial MCP server for Toggl Track written in Node.js (available as an npm package `@louis030195/toggl-mcp`). It exposes a set of tools (commands) that an AI or any MCP client can call to perform time tracking operations[^9]. The features supported include: starting and stopping time entries (timers), retrieving the current running entry, listing all time entries for today, listing all projects, deleting a time entry by ID, and even generating a weekly summary report (total hours tracked with breakdown by day and by project)[^9]. Essentially, it covers time entry CRUD (create via start, read via queries, update via stop, delete by ID) and basic project listing[^9]. It does not create new projects or clients (it can list projects so that you can reference them when starting timers).
      - **Usage:** Once the MCP server is running, you (or an AI agent) can issue natural language commands or JSON-formatted MCP requests such as: "Start tracking Project X – Design task for client Acme Corp" or "Stop the current timer", etc. The MCP server translates these into Toggl API actions. For example, the server defines tools like `toggl_start` (to start a new entry with a given description and project) and `toggl_stop` (to stop the running entry)[^9]. The weekly summary tool (`toggl_weekly`) can be invoked to get a report of hours tracked this week or a past week[^9].
      - **Projects/Clients:** This MCP interface allows listing projects (`toggl_projects`)[^9] so that an AI can query available project names/IDs. It does not support creating or editing projects/clients – those would still be done via Toggl's API or interface outside MCP. In usage, you might start an entry with a project name, and the MCP server will look up the project ID via the Toggl API. "Managing projects" in this context means you can fetch and choose existing projects, not create new ones[^9].
      - **Reports:** The inclusion of the weekly summary command is a nice addition – it provides a high-level report of total hours and breakdowns by day and project for the week[^9]. There's also a convenience tool `toggl_today` for listing today's entries and a `toggl_last_week` alias for last week's summary[^9]. For more complex reporting (arbitrary date ranges, filtering), you would still use Toggl's Reports API directly. But for conversational interfaces, these built-in summaries cover common needs (e.g., "How many hours did I work this week on Project X?").
      - **Usability & Notes:** This Node-based MCP server is open source (MIT)[^9]. It can be installed via npm and configured with your Toggl API token and workspace ID[^9]. One caveat is that MCP servers in general are meant to be run as background services or integrated in AI platforms – you wouldn't use this as a typical user-facing app by itself. It's most useful if you plan to control Toggl through natural language (for example, using an AI assistant that supports MCP). The developer provides instructions for integrating with Claude AI and others[^9]. In summary, the Toggl MCP (Node) is a handy bridge to make Toggl Track "AI-accessible," supporting all crucial time entry operations and simple reports[^9].
    - ### Toggl MCP Server (Python) – by Toggl MCP Contributors (PyPI toggl-mcp)
      - **Description:** Another unofficial MCP server for Toggl Track, this one implemented in Python. It's available via PyPI (`toggl-mcp`) and was released in late 2025[^13]. Like the Node version, it leverages Toggl Track's API v9 to perform actions, exposing them as MCP tools. While detailed documentation is lighter than the Node version, the core functionality is similar: it allows an MCP client to start and stop time entries, query current or recent entries, etc., using structured prompts or natural language. Essentially, it wraps the Toggl API endpoints (start time entry, stop entry, get running entry) in an MCP-compatible interface[^13].
      - **Capabilities:** This Python MCP server ensures full CRUD for time entries – you can create (start) entries, read data (e.g., list entries or get current entry), update (stop or edit running entry), and delete entries – through the MCP commands. It likely has equivalents to the Node version's tools, though named slightly differently. (For example, a command to start an entry, one to stop, one to fetch today's entries, etc.) Being maintained by "Toggl MCP Contributors," it seems to be a community effort to provide a Toggl integration in Python for the MCP ecosystem.
      - **Projects/Clients:** Based on what's known, this interface focuses on time entries primarily. There is no indication of project or client management features in the current version. It may allow specifying a project when starting an entry (so that the entry is associated with a project), but you would need to know the project name/ID up front. There isn't evidence of a "list projects" command in the Python MCP like the Node version has, so it might be limited in that regard (or the documentation is just sparse). For now, assume project and client CRUD are not directly exposed via this MCP server.
      - **Reports:** There's no mention of built-in reporting in the Python MCP server. It likely sticks to operational commands (tracking and retrieving entries). Any reporting (like totals) would have to be done by querying entries (e.g., "list my entries for today") and then summarizing on the client side. This is in contrast to the Node MCP which explicitly provided a weekly summary tool. The Python MCP server's goal appears to be enabling voice/AI control for basic Toggl operations rather than analytics.
      - **Usability & Notes:** The Python Toggl MCP server is open source (MIT license)[^13]. It can be run with a tool like Uvicorn (an ASGI server) or integrated into an MCP Gateway. The README on PyPI provides sample configuration for Cursor (another MCP client) and Claude AI[^13]. Essentially, you configure it with your `TOGGL_API_TOKEN` (and workspace) and then your AI assistant can invoke Toggl actions. If you are comfortable in Python and want to extend or tweak the MCP server, this is a good option. It's worth noting that MCP is a new and evolving protocol (born in late 2024[^20]), so these Toggl MCP projects are on the cutting edge – great for AI integration, but they do assume you have a use case involving conversational or autonomous AI agents. For standard automation needs, a direct CLI or SDK might be simpler.
  - ## SDKs and Libraries for Toggl Track
    - If you prefer to build your own tools or integrations, there are several software development kits (SDKs) and libraries for Toggl Track. These provide programmatic access to Toggl's API in various languages, abstracting the raw HTTP calls. Below are some of the open-source libraries (and one official, the API itself) that support full time entry CRUD, with notes on projects/clients and reports support:
    - **Python:** Officially, Toggl Track doesn't maintain an official Python SDK, but the community has the above-mentioned Toggl CLI (Python) which doubles as a library. It provides Python classes for TimeEntry, Project, Client, etc., that you can create, fetch, update, and delete in your own scripts[^1]. For example, you can do `api.TimeEntry(description="New entry", start=..., stop=...).save()` to create an entry, or call `api.TimeEntry.objects.all()` to list entries[^1]. Similarly, `api.Project.objects.get(id)` and `.save()` let you update project details[^1]. This essentially is an SDK built on the Toggl API. Another third-party library, `toggl-track` (PyPI) by Maurizio Branca, offers a Pythonic interface and CLI; however, it's relatively new (as of 2025) with fewer users[^21]. For most Python integrations, using the toggl-cli's API wrapper or simply calling the Toggl REST endpoints via requests (with the official docs) are common approaches.
    - **Node.js / TypeScript:** There are a couple of options. The newest is Toggl Track TypeScript Client (often just called `toggl-track` on npm) by Gary Tou, which specifically targets the API v9[^14]. This library is open source (MIT) and provides classes/methods to interact with Toggl. It currently supports time entries and projects (and tags) among others[^14]. For instance, you can create a time entry or fetch all time entries through a simple function call, rather than manually crafting HTTP requests. Project CRUD is supported (the author lists "Projects" as implemented, and possibly tags), but clients are not yet in his supported list. The library covers the Track API; the Reports API is not included. Another option is older community libraries, but many target API v8 which is deprecated.
    - **Go:** The Toggl-Go Client is an open-source Go library (MIT) that provides full CRUD for time entries, projects, and clients[^16]. It includes methods like `CreateTimeEntry`, `UpdateTimeEntry`, `DeleteTimeEntry`[^16], and similar for projects and clients[^16]. The Reports API is not implemented in this library. It's a solid choice if you're building Go-based tools or services that need to integrate with Toggl Track.
    - **.NET:** Toggl.Api for .NET is a third-party library (MIT) that partially supports Toggl API v9 for time entries, but many endpoints are missing[^15]. Some project and client operations are missing (WIP). It's available via NuGet for .NET 6+ and .NET 1.0+. For .NET developers, this provides a starting point, though you may need to supplement with direct API calls for missing features.
    - **Official Toggl API v9 (REST):** The official Toggl Track API is a RESTful HTTP API (no official GraphQL API). It provides endpoints to create, update, and delete time entries[^23] (e.g. `POST /time_entries`, `PUT/PATCH /time_entries/{id}`, `DELETE /time_entries/{id}`). It also supports full CRUD for projects[^24] and clients[^25], and includes a read-only Reports API v3 for summary and detailed data[^26]. This is the most complete option but requires you to handle HTTP requests, authentication, and response parsing yourself. Any language that can make HTTP requests can use this API.
