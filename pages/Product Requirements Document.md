	- ## What’s an Example of Product Requirements Document?
		- The following is a basic outline of what should be included in a PRD. There are no hard-and-fast rules for this, but these items are typically present:
		- **Objective/Goal:** Explain why are you building this and what do you hope to accomplish.
		- **Features:** For each feature, you should include a description, goal and use case at a minimum. Additional details may be helpful or necessary depending on the complexity of the feature, such as out-of-scope items.
		- **UX Flow & Design Notes:** Most organizations complete the UX design of features after the PRD has been reviewed and accepted. However, there may be some general guidance required at this stage to ensure the release objectives are met. This is not the place for pixel-perfect mockups or wireframes that map out every possible scenario; instead, it can be used to describe the overall user workflow.
		- **System & Environment Requirements:** Which end-user environments will be supported (such as browsers, operating systems, memory, and processing power, etc.).
		- **Assumptions, Constraints & Dependencies:** List out what is expected of users, any limits for the implementation to be aware of and any outside elements required for the final solution to be functional.
