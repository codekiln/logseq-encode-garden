- # Knowledge Gardens (KGs) and [[Knowledge/Base]] Knowledge Bases (KBs)
	- ## About
		- **Knowledge Gardens**, also known as Digital Gardens or Zettelkastens (a term derived from the German word for "slip box"), represent a method for personal knowledge management and nonlinear note-taking that emphasizes growth and interconnections of ideas. This approach has evolved over time and draws upon various historical threads.

	- ## #History
		- ### Early Roots
			- 1. **Zettelkasten Method (Late 20th Century):** The term "Zettelkasten" was popularized by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann in the late 20th century. Luhmann used a system of index cards to capture ideas and notes, linking them through a numbering system, which allowed for a web of interrelated thoughts. His method emphasized the importance of context and connections over linear organization.
			- 2. **Hypertext and Early Computing (1980s):** The advent of hypertext in the 1980s, exemplified by the works of pioneers like [[Person/Ted Nelson]] and [[Person/Tim Berners-Lee]], laid the groundwork for the interconnected nature of digital content. This technology allowed for the creation of non-linear pathways through information, which resonated with the principles behind Zettelkastens.
		- ### The Digital Age
			- 3. **[[Personal Knowledge Management]] (1990s – 2000s):** As personal computing became widespread, knowledge management tools emerged. Programs like [[App/Evernote]] and [[App/OneNote]] allowed users to collect and organize notes digitally, but often maintained a more traditional hierarchical structure rather than the interconnected, organic growth seen in Zettelkastens.
			- 4. **Rise of [[Wiki]] Culture (2000s):** The development of wikis, such as [[Wikipedia]], highlighted collaborative knowledge sharing and the non-linear organization of information. Wikis introduced concepts of linking and creating knowledge networks that aligned closely with the ideas behind Digital Gardens.
			- 5. **Digital Gardens and Notetaking (2010s):** The term "Digital Garden" began to gain popularity in the 2010s. Influencers and knowledge workers started promoting more aesthetically pleasing and navigable representations of personal knowledge systems. Digital Gardens are designed to be public-facing, emphasizing growth over curation, where ideas evolve over time.
		- ### Recent Developments
			- 6. **[[App/Roam Research]] and [[App/Obsidian]] (Late 2010s – Present):** The launch of tools like Roam Research and Obsidian has further propelled the Digital Garden concept. These applications facilitate bi-directional linking, graph views of notes, and easy navigation through a network of thoughts. Users can create an interconnected web of notes, mimicking the Zettelkasten philosophy in a modern digital context.
			- 7. **Community and Sharing:** The Digital Garden concept has fostered online communities where users share their gardens publicly. This has led to a culture of openness and collaboration, diverging from traditional note-taking practices where information was often siloed.
			- 8. **Adaptation Across Fields:** The Digital Garden approach is being adopted across disciplines, from academia to creative writing, innovation, and personal development. It reflects a shift towards valuing process, exploration, and the dynamic nature of knowledge.
