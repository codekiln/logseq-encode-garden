- # [Build Anything with MCP Agents, Hereâ€™s How - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQsP_PlCY1I)
	- ## Summary
		- presents two key [[MCP Servers]]: [[MCP/GitHub/servers/GitHub]] and [[MCP/Server/Browser Tools]]. The GitHub MCP allows users to easily manage repositories and perform tasks like creating files and updating code with minimal effort. The Browser Tools MCP acts as a powerful debugging assistant, simplifying code inspection and problem-solving. David encourages viewers to enable "YOLO mode" for greater efficiency, allowing the agent to operate autonomously without requiring constant approval for each action. He argues that setting up these tools now equips users with an advantage in a rapidly evolving tech landscape, ultimately enhancing productivity and innovation. The video serves as both a tutorial and a motivational call to action for those looking to leverage AI in their work.
	- ## Video
		- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQsP_PlCY1I}}
			- ## {{youtube-timestamp 0}}  Intro
			  collapsed:: true
				- {{youtube-timestamp 0}} my name is David Andre and in this video I'm going to teach you how to build anything with mCP and cursor even if you are a complete beginner the popularity of mCP is absolutely exploding it's clear that this is going to be the next
				- {{youtube-timestamp 12}} big thing but just like with e-commerce or social media most people are going to miss out so don't be one of them watch until the end and start using mCP real quick we just released Ultra search this is a new AI agent that takes deep
				- {{youtube-timestamp 26}} research to the next level simply tell it what you're looking for and it will personalized insights you won't find anywhere else and the best part you can start using it for free so go to vl. and sign up all right let's start by opening
				- {{youtube-timestamp 39}} cursor and then opening an empty project the next step is go to top left click on cursor settings cursor settings in here you need to navigate to mCP and this is where we're going to add our mCP servers so in this video I'm going to show you
				- {{youtube-timestamp 51}} two GitHub which is obviously super powerful and it can do all of these things then the second one is the one I'm really excited about browser tools that's why I would highly recommend you watch until the end because just adding
				- {{youtube-timestamp 61}} these two mCP servers makes cursor two to three times better and I'm not over exaggerating so when you first open cursor obviously you will not have any mCP servers right here which is fine the setup is relatively simple we're going
			- ## {{youtube-timestamp 73}} Setting up [[GitHub MCP]]
			  collapsed:: true
				- {{youtube-timestamp 73}} to start by setting up the GitHub mCP right so we're going to use one of the most popular ones which is from smiy and if you go in here they have a lot of different mCP servers but this one is the GitHub one right so what do we need
				- {{youtube-timestamp 84}} to do to start using it well we need a GitHub account so go to github.com and click on sign up this process is super easy takes like 20 seconds after you sign up you will be redirected to the homepage but we need to go into the
				- {{youtube-timestamp 96}} settings so pay attention click on the top right on your icon then navigate to settings on the left you need to scroll all the way down and find developer settings click on that and then click on personal access tokens we're going to do
				- {{youtube-timestamp 110}} a find grade token which lets us control how much access mCP has so when we add it into cursor you probably don't want it to delete your repository stuff like that all of that is within your control let's click on find grade tokens and
				- {{youtube-timestamp 121}} generate new token I'm going to name it cursor mCP set the expiration date to whatever you want and scroll down so I'm going to select all repositories and then we need to select the specific permissions so this actually is very
				- {{youtube-timestamp 134}} detailed so you can really spend time and think okay what do I want cursor to have access to right but to keep it simple just follow what I'm doing Administration read and write commit statuses read and write contents read
				- {{youtube-timestamp 146}} and write and issues read and write then scroll all the way down and click on generate token again you can set any permissions you want this is just what I selected for this video when you are in here go to the top right and click on
				- {{youtube-timestamp 157}} login and then you can connect with GitHub once you connect your GitHub account you should see your logo in the top right The Next Step then is to navigate to the GitHub mCP which is this one and then on the right side you can
				- {{youtube-timestamp 168}} select how you want to install it right so maybe use wind serve maybe use Klein we are using cursor in this video and in here you need to paste in your personal access token that you just generated now warning do do this at your own risk
				- {{youtube-timestamp 181}} while smiy AI is open source you should still probably be careful using your main GitHub account where you have sensitive rep stories so the next step is to copy the token go back to the mCP setup and paste it in here and click
				- {{youtube-timestamp 193}} generate command this will give us a command we can copy which inside of cursor we can run and set up the mCP server it's that simple like I'm telling you guys this is crazy now wait until you see the second mCP because this
			- ## {{youtube-timestamp 205}} [[GitHub/MCP]] #Demo #Example 1 - creating a repository
			  collapsed:: true
				- {{youtube-timestamp 205}} GitHub one is really really useful but the second one is just mind-blowing so again inside of cursor you need to go to cursor settings cursor settings and click on mCP then click on add new mCP give it a name so I'm going to just name
				- {{youtube-timestamp 219}} it GitHub and in the command field we want to paste in this exact install command given to us by the setup so paste it in here and click on add this is going to take a few seconds to connect you can actually click the
				- {{youtube-timestamp 230}} refresh file and then boom there it is when it's green we can start testing out so go to the cursor agent if you don't have it open just press command I create a new chat and then say create a new GitHub repo named welcome YouTube these
				- {{youtube-timestamp 245}} are all the tools this single MCB can do create update files search repositories create repositories blah blah blah it's pretty impressive right so let's test it out by creating a new GitHub repo now I'm going to go into the browser I'm
				- {{youtube-timestamp 256}} going to show you that this account has zero active repositories so let's just see if this works okay called MCB tool create repository and that should be it great reposter now created I'm going to refresh the site and just like that our
				- {{youtube-timestamp 269}} cursor agent created a brand new repository this is insane guys this is the future of working with cursor if you cannot see the implications of this really take a deep breath and look into the future the AI models available
				- {{youtube-timestamp 281}} inside of CER are only going to get better there are only going to be more and more mcps so all we will do is just like type what we want inside of cursor agent and especially if you have YOLO mode turned on which I would highly
				- {{youtube-timestamp 293}} recommend you to do and which is actually the next step on our Vector list right so we did set up the GitHub mCP the next step is to turn on YOLO mode mod because this takes it to the next level right so again in the cursor
				- {{youtube-timestamp 303}} settings click on features and then scroll a bit down until you see enable Yol mode click on this to enable it and now the cursor agent can activate the mcps without you having to approve every single one so I can say like create a
				- {{youtube-timestamp 316}} new read me file upload it to GitHub to our new repo boom it chooses to create one because it realized okay it doesn't have any active files and then great I've created and uploaded a comprehensive read media that MD file
				- {{youtube-timestamp 330}} we're going to switch back to GitHub click on the repo and there it is a read me file that's formatted properly created it in like 2 seconds this is insane guys we're living in the future I'm not joking please pay attention to
				- {{youtube-timestamp 342}} this video and actually after you finish watching this video go through it one more time and set this up in your cursor because if you have a few mCP servers in your cursor you have an insane advantage over everybody else I mean I don't know
				- {{youtube-timestamp 354}} how else to say it and again this is just one mCP just wait until you see what the second one does you don't even have to specify which tools to use see all I said is create a new readme file it checked the file contents realized
				- {{youtube-timestamp 366}} that okay there is no readme file so I guess the next thing I have to do is create or update a file now one pro tip right if you're having trouble with the cursor agent not recognizing tools or maybe you want to tell it which tools to
				- {{youtube-timestamp 378}} use and which tools to avoid what you can do is actually you can create a new folder named cursor and in this you can create a new subfolder named rules and in this folder you can create create a new file named mCP MD and here you can
				- {{youtube-timestamp 393}} put in all instructions for the mCP server so I can say instructions for mCP servers and then you can do you know GitHub and then you can give it all the tools like you know get file contents create or update file and stuff like
				- {{youtube-timestamp 407}} that it works the same as a cal rules file right but this lets you have more specialized files for even more control over how cursor behaves by the way if you want to see more AI tutorials like this please subscribe it tells me that
			- ## {{youtube-timestamp 419}} - Setting up #MCP #Example 2 - [[Chrome/DevTools]]
			  collapsed:: true
				- {{youtube-timestamp 419}} you guys are actually enjoying this content and that I should make more in-depth technical tutorials like this one so again if you want to see more stuff like this make sure to subscribe okay so now let's move to the second mCP
				- {{youtube-timestamp 430}} server which if I had this when I was building vectal right vectal is my AI startup if I had this mCP from the beginning man it would have saved me at least a week maybe even 10 days I mean I'm talking about week of development
				- {{youtube-timestamp 444}} time seven full days of full-time work this mCP would have saved me if I had it inside of cursor from the beginning so let me show you how to set this up first we need to go to this domain right here and again I'm going to link it below the
				- {{youtube-timestamp 457}} video once you go in here scroll down a bit until you see installation and the git clone command so first thing we have to copy this Command right here if you don't know what what is this like David I don't understand terminal whatever
				- {{youtube-timestamp 469}} don't worry take a deep breath no need to panic we have tools like curs right now cser agent is super powerful and it can run commands especially if you enabled Yola mode which by the way I'm going to show you how I set it up so
				- {{youtube-timestamp 480}} many people are missing out because they're scared to use YOLO mode inside of curser what it does is it auto runs commands terminal commands without asking you for confirmation however this is simply a skill issue pay attention
				- {{youtube-timestamp 493}} this prompt you can leave empty right command allow list you can add stuff in here or if if there's only like certain commands you wanted to run add it into the prompt right but here's the important part command deny list here
				- {{youtube-timestamp 504}} you should list out all of these commands and other commands you do not want cursor agent to run ever so as you can see these are very malicious commands that I put into the Deni list that will never be executed in curser
				- {{youtube-timestamp 518}} agent with yolo mode right but then even more important is this checkbox right here delete file protection if enabled it prevents the agent from deleting files automatically this is amazing right because you don't have to worry
				- {{youtube-timestamp 530}} about curser agent accidentally deleting some important file and messing up your project so if you properly set up these two things you absolutely don't have anything to fear about with yolo mode and it will save you so much time
				- {{youtube-timestamp 542}} especially with mcps because it can run all of these mCP tools automatically by itself okay so again copy this Command right here and let's go into our cursor agent actually I'm going to create a new chat just for clarity and I'm just going
				- {{youtube-timestamp 554}} to say run this terminal command boom and I'm going to give it this command and just make sure you use an AI model that can run the terminal currently all of the cloud models are fine gbt 4.5 while it's amazing right now Custer
				- {{youtube-timestamp 568}} didn't give it the ability to automatically run terminal command so just go with CLA 3.7 Sonet run this and say I'll run the git clone boom generating command automatically runs it and we can see on the right we have cloned the repo so this is like that
				- {{youtube-timestamp 582}} easy right you don't have to worry about anything you don't have to run any terminal opens terminals no when you enable Yola mode and when you have crust agent it will do all of the terminal stuff for you we really are living in
				- {{youtube-timestamp 594}} the future guys anyways go to your folders by the way you might have this on the left I just have it on the right because I don't want my camera to be covering the chat but by default curer vs code wind serf have the files on the
				- {{youtube-timestamp 605}} left and have the chat on the right so don't be confused by that everything is the same the next thing we need to do is install the Chrome extension that way this mCP can work right so go into the top right of your browser doesn't matter
				- {{youtube-timestamp 616}} if you looks Chrome Brave whatever just go to manage extensions right find the extensions and click on manage extensions then on the top right you need to enable developer mode by default it is disabled but if you enable it you
				- {{youtube-timestamp 628}} will see these three options right here we need to click on load unpacked so again go to extensions manage extensions enable developer mode and click on load unpacked then we need to navigate to where you just cloned this GitHub
				- {{youtube-timestamp 643}} repository right so this is cloned in our code folder so let's click on code browser tools mCP and then Chrome extension then click on select and boom there it is we just successfully imported the browser tools mCP Chrome
				- {{youtube-timestamp 656}} extension the step after that is to set up the browser tools m CP inside of cursor the same way we did with the GitHub one right so again settings cursor settings just like we did and mCP once you're in here we can click on add
				- {{youtube-timestamp 668}} new mCP let's go back and we need to get this exact Command right so give it a unique name such as browser tools basically this just cannot conflict with any other mcps you have right so obviously we have only GitHub so this
				- {{youtube-timestamp 680}} name is completely fine as for type make sure it's command for most mcps like 90% it will be command but sometimes you might need to do s so just follow the tutorial whatever mCP you're using right there are sites like smiy that have a
				- {{youtube-timestamp 695}} list of mcps that you can do again use them at your own risk because sometimes these mcps are developed by random people right like if you use some of these most popular ones you're probably going to be fine but if you use an mCP
				- {{youtube-timestamp 706}} with like seven downloads again I would be very careful anyways let's go back in here and let's copy this command and again I'm going to leave these below the video to make it as easy as possible for you guys switch to cursor and paste in
				- {{youtube-timestamp 718}} the command right right here click on ADD and now we have the second mCP inside of curer and there it is it's green once it's green we know we're good to go so you might be thinking like David okay you didn't even explain what
			- ## {{youtube-timestamp 730}} #Demo #Example 2 - #MCP that interacts with [[Chrome/DevTools]]
				- {{youtube-timestamp 730}} this mCP does well this mCP is basically your professional debugger imagine Haring a programmer to debug your code right VIP coding is amazing you can code you can easily create new files vipe debugging is much harder well thanks to
				- {{youtube-timestamp 745}} this mCP it just became five times easier let me show you actually there's one more step we have to do we have to start the browser tool server so let's copy this Command right here let's switch to cursor I'm going to create a
				- {{youtube-timestamp 757}} new chat I'm going to tell it run this command and then this is a good tip when you use CLA 3.7 Sonet make sure to say do not do anything else because this model has a tendency to overd deliver right it it goes crazy sometimes and it
				- {{youtube-timestamp 772}} tries to do way too much stuff so it's good to tell it like do not do anything else all right so now it started the server you can click on pop out Al that way it's not blocking the chat and now the mCP server is actually running for
				- {{youtube-timestamp 785}} the browser tools mCP so how can we know that right how do we know it's running well let's say we switch to any web app such as vectal I'm going to open the Chrome def tools console by pressing F12 or you can just do right click and
				- {{youtube-timestamp 798}} inspect element right now when you do this you will notice one thing you see at the top browser tools mCP started debugging this browser and actually we can go to the right side where we have you know console netor Network stuff
				- {{youtube-timestamp 809}} like that and click on these two arrows to the right and select browser tools mCP and here we can see what it can do right so it can capture screenshot wipe all the logs and we actually save the screenshot path so if you wanted to take
				- {{youtube-timestamp 821}} screenshots just add a path to your computer where you save your pictures whatever and add it in here and it can take screenshots by itself it's insane right so let's switch to cursor and actually test it out so as you can see
				- {{youtube-timestamp 833}} it has a lot of different tools this mCP can do get console logs console errors Network logs Network success logs screenshot and selected element again this is basically your professional front end debugger all right so let's
				- {{youtube-timestamp 846}} say I'm in vectal right here and I don't like the padding of something right I can select an element and say like okay this boom I'm going to say check the selected element and suggest how we could reduce the padding this is a super
				- {{youtube-timestamp 862}} simple prompt right you could see like okay the pading is here if we lower the number should be simple but look what it does I'll check with the selected element call mCP tools get selected element take a screenshot boom and say
				- {{youtube-timestamp 872}} based on the selected element I can see it has a class of px10 py6 which is St CSS panning on the left panning on the right here are my suggestions to reduce the panning and let me tell you this is insanely useful so let's say you're
				- {{youtube-timestamp 885}} inside your app that you're building right and there's like something that's really acting up you don't know which div it is which component it is you can simply select it you can tell Custer agent okay I've selected the element
				- {{youtube-timestamp 897}} help me debug this help me change it which file does this element reside in right sometimes you don't even know if you have a very large core base which front end file is controlling that exact element and how to change it well now
				- {{youtube-timestamp 910}} with this mCP it just became so insanely easy it's crazy and again this is just the first tool it can do let's do another one so let's say I go into vectal okay let me disable this and I create a new task right I'm going to
				- {{youtube-timestamp 922}} name it add voice input into vectal by the way this is something that we're releasing literally tomorrow there's going to be a voice button right here it's going to get crazy vectal is getting updates nearly every single day
				- {{youtube-timestamp 935}} no other software is improving just as fast as veal so if you're one of the people that really like to be hyperproductive and if you're using like old school task list like notion todoist or whatever switch to vectal we have
				- {{youtube-timestamp 946}} built-in AI agents that literally save you time organize your tasks help you create new tasks help you do web research on your work and just make your life so much more easier and since we added the free plan you can try vectal
				- {{youtube-timestamp 958}} for free so go to vl. sign up move all of your tasks all of your projects work over to vectal I promise you won't regret it anyways so now that we set up the browser tools mCP we need to test out the other tools it can do and the
				- {{youtube-timestamp 972}} console one is really crazy so let's say we we added a new task and now there's stuff in the console right what I'm going to do is I'm going to say check the stuff in our web console and explain what's going on so maybe when there's
				- {{youtube-timestamp 987}} there are errors right when something is going completely wrong you would say this it already knows which tool to call guys this is the crazy part is you don't have to and there is error right obviously right now it is buggy because
				- {{youtube-timestamp 999}} CLA 3.7 just released but this is not an issue with mCP this is an issue with anthropic being insanely overloaded this there is a very easy way to check that if you go to status. anthropic ccom you can see all the errors happening and the
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1011}} last few days there have been a lot of Errors so just keep it in mind this is related to CLA 3.7 Sonet and how insanely popular it is but the best advice I can give you is that if you run into any errors do not take them
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1023}} personally all errors are solvable especially with tools like cursor vectal where you can literally use Cutting Edge AI models such as CLA 3.7 and actually recently not many people know this recently we added GPT 4.5 that's right
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1037}} anyone on vectal Pro can use GPT 4.5 in their chat which by the way right now you can only access on CH gbd Pro for $200 a month which is just crazy right vectal Pro costs only $30 a month and you get so much other stuff such as
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1052}} Ultra search which is literally powered by perplexity deep research let me show you this feature because this is super underrated how do I install cursor on my MacBook right anything you can ask it anything and here it is ultra search is
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1065}} a very powerful web search agent I would argue it's one of the best in the world why how can I say that well it's built on top of perplexity deep research so a lot of you are already paying $20 a month for perplexity Pro right there is
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1078}} absolutely no need for that in vectal you get perplexity Pro in the chat for free but the big difference between Ultras search and all the other deep research features is that in vectal we take all of your tasks all of your user
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1091}} context into consideration so whatever the search results are they'll be super relevant to you and to you only this is why ultr search is one of the most useful web search agents in the world and why all vectal users are absolutely
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1104}} loving it and again you can start using it for free if you want to have nearly unlimited access access to this as well as reasoning GPD 4.5 clo 3.7 Sonet deeps R1 I mean we have so much stuff inside of veal all of that is available on
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1116}} vectal Pro just go to v. set up a free account and I promise you won't regret it so let's see how this mCP worked right so I said check the stuff in our web console and explain what's going on if you are not a frontend developer like
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1129}} me you would be completely confused by go what's going on in the console right there's like stuff in here you don't know what's happening especially when there's errors right now it's pretty simple but when there are random matter
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1138}} is happening it can get really confusing real quick trust me I built this startup myself with no previous experience and I wasted many many days debugging front and errors I just wished I had set up MCB sooner so don't make the same
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1152}} mistake on me sit down for 30 minutes and set up these mcps it will save you time forever for the rest of your life from this simple prompt again this is written in plain English any even a child can type this check the stuff in
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1163}} our web console and explain what's going on super simple English and look what cursor agent does so this is why I would highly recommend you set up YOLO mode if you did not have YOLO mode you would need to approve all of these and a click
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1176}} click click that's not agentic that's not autonomous agents right don't be scared enable Yol mode and just sit back and save yourself time so from this simple prompt cursor agent called four different mCP tools get console locks
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1191}} get console errors get network error locks and get network success locks guys if you were to do this manually if you were to go in here and say like okay what's in the console you know you click through this you read through this okay
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1203}} what's happening in the network blah blah blah okay I'm going to complete this then there's some stuff okay you you debug this it takes so much time you can just type in a prom this took me like five seven seconds to write then
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1216}} cursor explains it so as you can see this is a super simple explanation to what's happening inside of all these front end Chrome Dev tools things that if you are not a front end developer you would have no chance understand standing
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1229}} and if you ran into an error which will happen sooner or later especially if you do Vibe coding right if you're using tools like cursor bulld doog new lovable you will run into errors building with these tools is fun it's easy you can get
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1241}} an MVP running super fast debugging and solving errors is much much harder but if you set up these two mcps you're already ahead of 99.9% of people and I'm I truly mean that 99 9% of people will not take the time to set this up and
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1256}} maybe if the console logs are enough there is a tool take screenshot right so it can even take a screenshot of your entire front end which again you could do that manually but why would you why would you spend like multiple seconds
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1268}} like okay there's a screenshot boom I'm going to copy this to clipboard go into cursor all of this is friction all of this is slowness you can literally have the cursor agent doing this within split seconds if you have Yol mode enabled and
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1283}} if you have this mCP setup guys I really urge you to take a deep breath and look into the future because this this is only the beginning imagine how this will look like in 3 months imagine how this will look like in 6 months
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1294}} there's going to be more and more mcps and the the mcps are going to become more and more powerful new AI models are being released literally every week cursor is being updated multiple times a week mcps are being added every single
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1306}} day in six months all we will have to do is type what you want to create in plain English and cursor agent will do the rest for you this is why you have to take action today set this up today so that you are ready when these things
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1319}} come and you don't scramble at the last possible moment when it's already going Mega viral right and when the adoption curve has started and when when your Uber driver or your cashier is talking about like oh are you building AI agents
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1331}} are you using cursor that's too late you want to be at The Cutting Edge you want to have the first movers Advantage which means you have to take action now I know this video is a bit long and it maybe is not the simplest video you've seen but
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1344}} if you do these steps anybody can do them I don't care if you're 1 years old I don't care care if you're 80 years old you can do these steps even if you're not a programmer and now speaking from experience guys I've built v. a a full
				- {{youtube-timestamp 1356}} startup with like 8,000 active users currently that's making over $10,000 a month yesterday we literally hit 10K Mr this startup is worth already hundreds of thousands of dollars if I were to sell it today and I built it with curer
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1371}} speaking plain English with AI guys wake up you can do this all of you can do this I never built a startup before four and I did it took me 2 months sure but 2 months is better than 2 years without curser would have taken me at least a
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1385}} year this is the future this is the moment where things are happening so please don't be one of the majority don't be one of the mediocre people that watch this don't take any action and then just you know go and watch TV or
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1398}} watch Netflix this has actually been requested by members of the new Society so people in the new Society have told me David we wanton a tutorial on mCP and that's what I made it so by the way if you want to have influence over which
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1410}} videos I make make sure to join the new Society this is an exclusive Community with over 700 people at The Cutting Edge of AI and what's even better is that in the classroom we have a lot of exclusive content such as how to build your first
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1422}} AI agent how to make your first, with AI and how to build an AI startup where I outlined every single step from day one of me building veal from choosing the idea to literally setting up the project en cursor to current day where veal just
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1437}} crossed 10,000 000 Mr monthly recurring Revenue all of that you can access in the new society and much much more there's a lot right so if you're serious about Ai and if you want to be at The Cutting Edge make sure to join the new
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1449}} Society it's going to be linked below with that being said thank you guys for watching hopefully you found this video valuable if you did make sure to subscribe and if you are a professional someone you know manager programmer
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1460}} content creator business owner go to v. and sign up this is the future of productivity forget all the other non-intelligent task management tools right this one is all you need we're using Advanced AI agents powered by the
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1473}} latest and greatest AI models such as GPT 4.5 and CLA 3.7 Sonet to save you as much time as possible and not only can you get started for free you can also join the vectal Discord server which by the way the button is in the bottom
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1485}} right and you can literally see every single day updates if you run into some bug report it and within a few hours our developers will fix it nearly every single day we're pushing new updates Buck fixes and Improvement to vectal I
			- {{youtube-timestamp 1498}} don't think there's many other software companies that can say that so again go to v. a sign up move all of your tasks over and I promise you won't look back with that being said thank you guys for watching and have a wonderful productive week see you
