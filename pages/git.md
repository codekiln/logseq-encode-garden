		- Branching and merging are lightweight and fast
		- Supports non-linear development workflows
	- ## Common Commands
		- `git init` — initialize a new repository
		- `git clone` — clone an existing repository
		- `git commit` — record changes to the repository
		- `git push` / `git pull` — synchronize with a remote repository
