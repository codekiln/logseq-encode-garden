- # Carcinisation Conceptual Overview
	- ## Overview
		- Carcinisation is an evolutionary pattern where distantly related crustaceans evolve crab-like body forms
		- It is a classic example of convergent evolution, where similar forms arise under similar pressures
		- The phenomenon appears multiple times across decapod crustaceans
	- ## Context
		- **Taxonomic Scope**: Most often discussed in decapods (e.g., true crabs, king crabs, porcelain crabs)
		- **Historical Framing**: The term highlights repeated evolution toward a compact, crab-like body plan
		- **Modern Relevance**: Used to study convergent evolution, form-function relationships, and developmental constraints
	- ## Key Principles
		- **Convergence**: Similar body forms can evolve independently from different ancestors
		- **Selection Pressures**: Crab-like shapes may offer advantages in mobility, protection, and ecological niche use
		- **Modularity**: Body segments can reorganize through evolutionary changes in development
		- **Constraint and Opportunity**: Repeated outcomes suggest a limited set of viable morphological solutions
	- ## Mechanism
		- Changes in segment proportions can shorten the abdomen and broaden the carapace
		- Folding the abdomen under the body creates a compact, crab-like silhouette
		- Limb specialization supports sideways walking and substrate interaction
		- Similar ecological pressures can channel different lineages toward the same overall form
	- ## Examples
		- **True crabs (Brachyura)**: The archetypal crab-like form
		- **King crabs (Lithodidae)**: Evolved crab-like features from hermit crab ancestors
		- **Porcelain crabs (Porcellanidae)**: Crab-like appearance despite distinct ancestry
	- ## Misconceptions
		- Carcinisation means all crab-like animals are closely related → **False**. Many are only distantly related
		- Carcinisation happened only once → **False**. It has occurred multiple times independently
		- Crab-like form is always superior → **False**. It is advantageous in some ecological contexts, not all
