- **CONCERT #13** — Thursday June 12; 8 – 9 : 30 pm — 132 Ipswich St., Rm 106, Boston Conservatory at Berklee
	- **Berklee** *The Space Between* — Manuela Cardona Garcia
	- **863** *Music for Immediate Ensemble, improvisation for VR synth, live electronics with face tracking & live video* — Itza Garcia Ordoñez, Tobias Fandel
		- Performers: Itza Garcia Ordoñez (SynthVR); Tobias Fandel (live electronics with face tracking & live video)
		- Description: Music for Immediate Ensemble weaves real-time VR synthesis, Wi-Fi audio/video casting, analog video-mixer disruptions and Unreal-Engine visuals steered by eye-tracking, creating an on-stage chain of gesture-to-media metamorphosis that passes “from body to virtual, from grin to sound, from glance to feedback.”
		- Author bios: **Itzá García** (b. 1993, Mexico) explores interdisciplinary composition, VR instruments and decolonial practice; pursuing a PhD at CUNY. **Tobias Fandel** is a Brooklyn-based composer/visual artist focused on media entanglement in performance.
	- **446** *Birds, for piano and fixed media* — Christopher Cook
		- Performers: Mary Hellmann (piano)
		- Description: Written for pianist Mary Hellmann, the piece layers recorded and synthetic birdsong against pianistic gestures; species flit through the texture, disappearing as quickly as they arrive.
		- Author bio: Christopher Cook (DMA, Univ. Texas) writes instrumental, electro-acoustic and operatic music; Professor of Music, Chowan University.
	- **696** *Harmonic Turbulences* — Gaël Moriceau
		- Performers: Gaël Moriceau (T-Stick)
		- Description: A solo T-Stick work exploiting the controller’s gestural nuance to sculpt shifting noise-grains and harmonic spectra that whirl like turbulent airflow before settling into resonant drones.
	- **491** *Air Sampling #007 – Air Guitar, for e-Guitar and SoundSpaceXR* — Grégory Beller, Kieran McAuliffe
		- Performers: Grégory Beller (SoundSpaceXR); Kieran McAuliffe (e-Guitar)
		- Description: Live guitar gestures are captured in XR space and “re-sampled” by SoundSpaceXR, spawning an audiovisual feedback loop where virtual strings and real strings trade riffs in mid-air.
	- **894** *Let’s play together? for piano, live video & electronics* — Alexey Logunov
		- Performers: Alexey Logunov (piano)
		- Description: A meditation on latency and presence: the solo pianist duets with delayed video clones while electronics stretch and fold the acoustic signal, questioning co-presence in networked music.
	- **723** *His Dreams, I. Iron Horses, for solo piano and fixed media* — Zouning “Anne” Liao
		- Performers: Alexey Logunov (piano)
		- Description: Piano interlocks with industrial samples—steam whistles, clanking rails—to evoke childhood visions of locomotives powering inexorably across the landscape of memory.
	- **557** *Pazhvak Astaneh, for viola, electronics & lights* — Pedram Diba
		- Performers: Long Okada (viola)
		- Description: Micro-tonal viola lines trigger realtime spectral processing and synchronized light pulses, tracing the threshold (“Astaneh”) between acoustic breath and electro-luminous after-image.
	- **692** *Camouflage* — Dan VanHassel
		- Description: Piano with live electronics conceals, erases and re-paints its own material; as timbres disappear into processed shadows, the work asks how performers mask emotion in a technological veil.
	- **720** *separación* — Orlando Garcia
		- Description: Sparse saxophone-derived electronics drift apart like estranged voices across a stereo field; subtle harmonic beating underscores the quiet ache implied by the title.
	- **638** *Union of Workers* — Margaret Schedel
		- Description: Granular resynthesis of factory sounds combines with data-driven pitch systems to comment on labor, automation and collective action in 21-century industry.
	- **754** *Oscillations (iii)* — Juan Vassallo
		- Description: The third panel in a cycle exploring rhythmic entrainment and social resonance; interleaves sine-swells with spoken-word fragments about acceptance.
	- **531** *Sky Stars* — Douglas Geers
		- Description: An electro-acoustic nocturne where processed string harmonics shimmer like distant constellations; invites meditative group listening.
