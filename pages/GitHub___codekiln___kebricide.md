	- `yarn dev` starts the watcher inside the [[VSCode/Dev Container]]
	- TODO how do I add `Project/Device.amxd` to #Ableton ?
		- DONE where is my repo? ANS: `Documents/GithHub/kebricide`
		- I think `.amxd` is a single max object
		- In order to add it, do I need to make sure it appears in my max path? Or is it simply a matter of dragging and dropping?
			- I thought [[Person/Zack Steinkamp]]  had a blog post about this, but it turned out I couldn't find one.
			- ## #Answer - yes, you just need to drag and drop [[c74/M4L/.amxd]]
