- # Deep Questions – Episode 373
	- ## "The Internet's Best Advice for Reinventing Your Life"
		- Cal Newport (Snipd highlights synthesis)
		- Below is a detailed reconstruction of the main ideas Cal Newport explored in episode 373, enriched with direct links to podcast excerpts.
	- ### 1. Empty Your Head Weekly
		- **Brain-dump list** – a single, digital task inventory
			- Why it matters: Working-memory overload turns many loose obligations into an anxious "amorphous blob". Writing them down expands "mental RAM" and removes the constant fear of forgetting.
			- How to do it:
				- 1. Maintain one master list
				- 2. **Every week** add new items **and cross-off** stale ones – don't recreate the whole thing from scratch
				- 3. On Friday/Sun/Mon briefly scan and **circle a handful of tasks** that really matter this week

	- ### 2. Run Your Life From **One Task System**
		- Digital beats paper once the list is large
		- Cal experimented with **Things 3** ("old-fashioned software – pay once, beautiful, opinionated")
		- Keep complicated, team-driven projects in Trello; personal/home obligations in a light-weight list

	- ### 3. Information Hygiene – *"Mind = Digestive System"*
		- 1. **Consume too little → boredom**; too much → anxiety
		- 2. Stay on the edge between the two
		- [Mind as Digestive System](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e15bfeb-320d-47ec-83b8-4f4fd6ee4063)
		- #### 3.1 30-Day Information Audit
			- Log daily time (or pages/episodes) for each medium (social, YouTube, streaming, reading, podcasts…)
			- Add a daily "Collins score" (–2 to +2 subjective quality)
			- After 30 days sort/scan for patterns → design an **Information Consumption Plan** that maximises +2 days and minimises –2 days

	- ### 4. **Slayable Dragons** – Goal-Setting After Jordan Peterson
		- 1. **Have a vision** for each life-bucket (health, work, relationships…). A short narrative of what "good" looks like
		- 2. Pick **one "next goal"** that moves closer to the vision; it must be *challenging yet clearly attainable* (a "slayable dragon")
		- 3. Work on only **one-to-two next goals at a time** to avoid log-jams. Finish, then choose the next dragon

	- ### 5. **Read Fewer—but Harder—Books**
		- Seneca & Ryan Holiday: linger on "master-thinker" works rather than inhaling trivia
		- Cal's **Book-Complexity Ladder**:
			- Rung 1: Secondary sources that unpack hard ideas (Example: *At the Existentialist Café*) - Warm-up
			- Rung 2: Accessible primary texts (Example: *Man's Search for Meaning*) - Direct but readable insight
			- Rung 3: "Approachable-yet-tough" classics (Example: *Walden*; *Letters from a Stoic*) - Train for ambiguity
			- Rung 4: Primary texts that *require* prep (Example: Jung, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Joyce) - Deep intellectual rewiring

	- ### 6. Multi-Scale Planning (Quarter ➜ Week ➜ Day)
		- 1. **Seasonal/Quarterly plan** – big objectives & deadlines
		- 2. **Weekly plan** – review calendar + brain-dump + quarterly plan; decide what to advance, block multi-hour tasks on the calendar immediately
		- 3. **Daily time-block plan** – copy fixed appointments first, then plan remaining hours; shutdown when done

	- ### 7. Capture **Resonance Notes**
		- Whenever a scene, person or idea **"hits in the gut"**, jot *what it was* & *the feeling it sparked*
		- **Don't analyse yet**; review monthly to detect recurring themes—these guide evolving visions
		- [Capture-what-resonates method](https://share.snipd.com/snip/34082047-679c-4937-a96e-5316e5ba98b1)
	- ### 8. Visions = *Lifestyle Properties*, not Details
		- Good vision statement: "I rarely work past 5 p.m., and spontaneous afternoons off are accepted."
		- Bad vision statement: "I am VP of Product at X." (too specific)
		- Also avoid vagueness ("A life full of love"). Make it observable & multi-path
		- [Properties vs. Details](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ad09aed4-15f3-460c-bab4-63354311074f)
	- ### 9. Evidence-Based Career Moves
		- Vet every proposed training or pivot by **talking to incumbents**; confirm job realities, hiring funnels, salary, hours
		- Only pursue steps that demonstrably raise the probability of reaching the vision
		- [Evidence-based planning](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3938d778-ae41-4d67-9e02-35a56ddd835f)
	- ### 10. Lifestyle-Centric Planning in Action
		- **Case study – "Reese"**
			- Picked residential construction (not his degree) because it matched lifestyle properties: flexibility, location, home ownership
			- Doubled down: built career-capital ➜ promotions ➜ even more flexibility
			- Dropped social media; journals, reads, gardens; aiming for 3-day weeks once mortgage is gone

	- ### 11. Seasons of Life: Working With Young Children
		- "Bunker mode" = keep wheels on, forget Manager-of-the-Year ambitions
		- Tight time-blocking, autopilot routines, shallow-work bias, explicit workload caps
		- No guilt: different seasons emphasise different buckets
		- [Adapt work strategy for young kids](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7bf0dd64-bd16-44a6-a65d-2b187d9cc74f)
	- ### 12. *The Great Lock-In* & The Missing Piece
		- Gen-Z TikTok trend: spend the last 4 months of 2025 "locked-in" on personal goals (Deep-Work vibe)
		- Cal's caution: without solid **mechanics for selecting and executing good goals**, the lock-in becomes just another brittle challenge

	- ## Five-Point Reset Cheat-Sheet (Cal's own wrap-up)
		- 1. **Maintain & Weekly-Review a Brain-Dump**
		- 2. **Plan Information Diet** (run the 30-day log)
		- 3. **Pursue Slayable Goals** (Vision ≠ Goal; focus few)
		- 4. **Read Up the Complexity Ladder**
		- 5. **Control Time at Multiple Scales**

	- ## Key Take-away
		- Radical, single-shot lifestyle makeovers rarely stick
		- A sustainable "reinvention" emerges when one:
			- 1. Articulate **clear lifestyle properties** for each area
			- 2. Choose **evidence-backed, tractable next goals**
			- 3. Drive them with **multi-scale planning** and clean **information/attention hygiene**
			- 4. Iterate—season by season—until lived reality converges with the vision
