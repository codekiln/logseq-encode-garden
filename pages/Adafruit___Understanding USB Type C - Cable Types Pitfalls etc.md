	- ## E-Marker Chips Inside Cables
		- All Type-C cables except the minimal combination of USB 2.0 and only 3 A must contain E-Marker chips that identify the cable and its capabilities via the USB PD protocol. This identification data includes information about product/vendor, cable connectors, USB signalling protocol (2.0, Gen speed rating , Gen 2), passive/active construction, use of VCONN power, available VBUS current, latency, RX/TX directionality, SOP controller mode, and hardware/firmware version. It also can include further vendor-defined messages (VDM) that detail support for Alt modes or vendor specific functionality outside of the USB standards.
