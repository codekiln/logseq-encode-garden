alias:: [[CursorAI/Docs/Account/Usage/Usage-based Pricing]]

- https://docs.cursor.com/account/usage#usage-based-pricing
- > Applies to models like Claude Opus and the o1 models that have daily limits.
- You may opt in to usage-based pricing for requests that **go beyond what is included in your Pro or Business plan** from the [[CursorAI/Dashboard]].
- You can also configure a **spend limit** in USD to make sure you never go over that. **Once the spending limit is hit, [[CursorAI/Requests/Slow]] will be used**.
- This is required for [[CursorAI/Usage-Based Pricing/For Premium Models]] to be enabled.
