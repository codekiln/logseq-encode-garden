				- > It runs a local libp2p peer, not a traditional server. On LAN it finds peers via mDNS and connects directly over QUIC/TCP; if Windows asks, allow on Private networks. No port forwarding. For comparison, Syncthing or Tailscale need ports/VPN; DreamFactory I use for quick DB APIs. So, peer not server.
