- # How To Batch Export [[Ableton/Clip/.alc]] Clips to [[.wav files]] in #Ableton Live
	- ## Goal
		- Export multiple `.alc` (Ableton Live Clip) files to separate `.wav` audio files efficiently.
	- ## Preconditions
		- Ableton Live installed (version 10 or later).
		- `.alc` clip files available in the Ableton Browser.
		- Familiarity with Arrangement View and Session View.
	- ## Procedure
		- ### 1. Manual Render from Arrangement View (Most Reliable)
			- Create a new Ableton Live project.
			- Drag each `.alc` clip from the Browser into its own track in Arrangement View.
			- Arrange clips sequentially (one after another) if you require a single bounce with individual outputs.
			- Go to `File â†’ Export Audio/Video`.
				- Set **Rendered Track** to **All Individual Tracks**.
				- Choose **WAV** as File Type.
				- Configure Sample Rate and Bit Depth as desired.
				- Adjust Rendering Options (e.g., disable Normalize).
			- Click **Export**; Ableton will render each track as a separate `.wav` named after the track.
			- *Tip:* Rename tracks to match clip names before exporting for clear file names.
		- ### 2. Session View Consolidate + Export (Semi-Automated)
			- Load each `.alc` clip into its own track in Session View.
			- Launch each clip to verify its content.
			- Right-click each clip and choose **Consolidate** (`CMD + J` / `Ctrl + J`).
			- Right-click the consolidated clip and select **Show in Finder** (macOS) or **Show in Explorer** (Windows).
				- Locate the `.wav` file under `Project/Samples/Processed/Consolidate`.
			- Rename and relocate the `.wav` files as needed.
	- ## Troubleshooting
		- *Clips not consolidating:* Ensure each clip is selected before consolidating.
		- *Missing export files:* Verify export path in Ableton preferences.
