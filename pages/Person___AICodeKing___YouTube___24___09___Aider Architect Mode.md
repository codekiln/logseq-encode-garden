# [Aider (Upgraded) : This Coding Agent just got BETTER with Architect Mode, Gemini-002 Support & More! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPXslklVBZc)
	- ## [[Video]]
		- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPXslklVBZc}}
		- ### {{youtube-timestamp 0}} Introduction
			- Recent version updates since last video:
				- Bug fix for dependency conflict between [[aider/Chat]] and [[Playwright]]
				- Major version update with significant new features
		- ### {{youtube-timestamp 40}} Architect Mode Overview
			- #### Core Concept
				- Experimental support using two models for coding tasks:
					- [[aider/mode/Architect]] Plans and describes solution approach
						- Generates outline for how to implement solution
					- [[aider/mode/Editor]] Converts plan into specific code edits
			- #### How It Works
				- 1. Architect model receives prompt and generates solution outline
				- 2. Editor model receives outline and produces code changes
				- Note: Process is **one-way** (non-agentic) - architect doesn't review final code
		- ### {{youtube-timestamp 119}} Performance Benchmarks
			- #### Top Performing Combinations
				- Best combination: GPT-4-1106-Preview + DeepSeek
					- Achieves ~85% success rate
					- Uses whole edit format
				- Second best: GPT-4-1106-Preview + Claude-3 Sonnet
					- Scores ~83% in diff edit format
				- DeepSeek + GPT-4 combination
					- Achieves ~80.5% success rate
			- #### Key Findings
				- Better results with architect model, but higher token usage
				- DeepSeek particularly effective as editor model
				- Most models improve when used in architect-editor pairs
		- ### {{youtube-timestamp 309}} Additional New Features
			- #### Model Integration Updates
				- New shortcuts for GPT-4-1106-Preview and mini versions
				- Support for Gemini-002 models
				- Better compatibility with LightLLM
			- #### UI/UX Improvements
				- New completion menu colors
				- Voice format switching (wave/MP3/webm)
				- Improved URL scraping with HTTP redirect support
				- Enhanced Vim mode cursor shapes
		- ### {{youtube-timestamp 371}} Using Architect Mode
			- #### Setup Instructions
				- Install development version using command from optional steps page
			- #### Usage Patterns
				- Basic usage: Add architect operator to set model roles
				- Can override editor model with `editor_model` operator
				- Example configurations:
					- GPT-4-1106-Preview as architect + Claude-3 Sonnet as editor
					- Single-prompt architect mode using `/architect` command
		- ### {{youtube-timestamp 693}} Gemini Integration
			- #### Features
				- Free tier available
				- Works well with Flask applications
				- Example: Creating a Finance Tracker app
		- ### {{youtube-timestamp 757}} Conclusion
