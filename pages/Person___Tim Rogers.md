- # About
	- I'm Tim, and I'm a product leader and polyglot software engineer based in London, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
	- Today,Â **I'm a Product Manager at GitHub working on [[GitHub/CoPilot]]**. We're building a conversational, personalised assistant to make developers happier and more productive.
	- In my spare time, I love to code, whether that's buildingÂ [cool products](https://foreigncurrencysavings.co.uk/)Â or hacking on open-source projects.
	- I'm the maintainer ofÂ [Restforce](https://github.com/restforce/restforce), the most popular [[Ruby]] ðŸ’Ž library for working with the Salesforce API, andÂ [`obsidian-share-as-gist`](https://github.com/timrogers/obsidian-share-as-gist), anÂ [[Obsidian]] extension for sharing your notes as [[GitHub/Gist]]s.
