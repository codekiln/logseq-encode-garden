- # How to play a section of the arrangement view in a loop
	- ## Steps
		- **Make a time selection** over the part of the clip you want to hear (even if it's in the middle of a clip).
			- See also [[Ableton/Arrangement View/Clip/How To/Select in a not quantized way]] if that's desired
		- **Right-click** the top timeline or the selection and choose:
			- ✅ **"Loop Selection"**, or
			- Press **CMD+L** (Mac) / **CTRL+L** (Windows) to set the loop to that selection.
		- Then hit **Play** — Live will loop that section of the arrangement.
	- ## How to avoid clicks when playing in a loop
		- none of these methods are automatic, unfortunately. They are very "click and drag"-y.
		- right click and split the section of the clip into a new clip
			- To avoid clicks when looping a split clip in Arrangement View, you want to ensure **smooth transitions at loop points**, ideally at **zero crossings**. Here’s how to do that in Ableton Live:
			- ### **1. Use Fade Handles (Crossfade at Edges)**
				- Live automatically creates fade handles on audio clips. To enable and adjust them:
				- **Enable fades**: Press **[Cmd]+[Alt]+[F]** (Mac) or **[Ctrl]+[Alt]+[F]** (Windows) to show fade handles.
				- **Manually drag** the **in/out fades** of the clip to taper the edges to zero.
				- This smooths the start and end, reducing clicks at the loop point.
			- ### **2. Snap to Zero Crossings (in Clip View)**
				- You can make selections or adjust loop/warp markers in the **Clip View**:
				- **Double-click** the audio clip to open **Clip View**.
				- Zoom in at the **loop start and end markers**.
				- Drag the start/end or loop brace **until the waveform is at or near a zero crossing** (where the waveform crosses the center line).
				- It’s manual, but ensures no jump in amplitude.
			- ### **3. Use Warp Mode Carefully**
				- If you’re using **Warping**, set it to a mode that minimizes transient artifacts:
				- Try **“Complex”** or **“Complex Pro”** for full mixes.
				- Use **“Tones”** or **“Texture”** for smoother loops on single-instrument sounds.
			- ### **4. Consolidate and Crossfade (if needed)**
				- If you’ve split the clip and it clicks:
				- Select both parts, press **[Cmd]+[J]** (Mac) or **[Ctrl]+[J]** (Win) to **consolidate** them.
				- Apply fades at the loop start/end manually again if needed.
			- Clicks usually happen when the start or end of a loop isn’t near a zero crossing or there’s a sudden change in waveform amplitude. Fades + careful marker placement is the fix.
