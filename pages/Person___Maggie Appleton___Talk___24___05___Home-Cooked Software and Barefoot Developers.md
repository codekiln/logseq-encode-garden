- # [Home-Cooked Software and Barefoot Developers](https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software)
	- ## Maggie's Notes
		- This is a talk I presented [Local-first Conference](https://www.localfirstconf.com/) in Berlin, May 20241ya . It’s specifically directed at the [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) community, but its relevant to anyone involved in building software.
		- For the last ~year I’ve been keeping a close eye on how language models capabilities meaningfully change the speed, ease, and accessibility of software development. The slightly bold theory I put forward in this talk is that we’re on a verge of a golden age of local, home-cooked software and a new kind of developer – what I’ve called the "barefoot developer" ([[Dev/Barefoot]]).
