- # GitHub Codespaces - https://github.com/features/codespaces
	- ## Overview
		- Cloud-based development environments powered by [[DevContainer]]
		- Runs in the cloud on GitHub's infrastructure as Docker containers on virtual machines
		- Fully configured development environment accessible from anywhere
		- Based on [[VSCode]] and [[Dev Container]] specifications
		- Default environment uses Ubuntu Linux with popular languages and tools pre-installed
	- ## Key Features
		- Pre-configured development environments with configuration-as-code
		- Access from web browser, [[VSCode]] desktop, or [[GitHub/CLI]]
		- Powered by [[Azure]] infrastructure
		- Integrated with [[GitHub]] repositories
		- Supports [[Dev Container]] configurations
		- Settings Sync and dotfiles for personalization
		- Built-in source control
	- ## Machine Types
		- Available specifications range from 2 cores to 32 cores
		- Options may be limited by organizational policies or repository requirements
		- Machine type can be changed at any time through web, [[VSCode]], or [[GitHub/CLI]]
		- ### Available Configurations
			- 2-core machines (base configuration)
			- 4-core machines
			- 8-core machines
			- 16-core machines
			- 32-core machines with 128GB RAM (for ML workloads)
		- ### How to Change Machine Type
			- **Web**: Navigate to github.com/codespaces → ellipsis menu → "Change machine type"
			- **VSCode**: Command Palette → "Codespaces: Change Machine Type"
			- **CLI**: `gh codespace edit --machine MACHINE-TYPE-NAME`
	- ## Lifecycle & Persistence
		- ### Creation
			- Can be created from repositories or templates
			- Limits on simultaneous running codespaces
			- Prebuilds can accelerate setup (if enabled by repository admin)
		- ### Running State
			- **CRITICAL**: Closing browser/editor does NOT stop the codespace
			- Running processes continue after disconnect
			- Must explicitly stop the codespace or wait for timeout
			- Can reconnect to running codespace at any time
		- ### Stopping
			- Stopped codespaces retain all saved changes
			- Only storage costs apply when stopped (no compute charges)
			- Data persists until codespace is deleted or auto-deleted after 30 days
			- **Methods to Stop**:
				- Web: github.com/codespaces → ellipsis menu → "Stop codespace"
				- CLI: `gh codespace stop`
				- VSCode: Command Palette → "Codespaces: Stop Codespace"
		- ### Deletion
			- Permanent removal of codespace and all data
			- Changes must be pushed to remote repository before deletion to preserve work
	- ## Timeout Configuration
		- ### Default Behavior
			- Auto-stops after 30 minutes of inactivity by default
			- Inactivity = no typing, mouse movement, or terminal activity
			- "Your data is preserved from the last time your changes were saved"
		- ### Configurable Range
			- Minimum: 5 minutes
			- Maximum: 240 minutes (4 hours)
			- Organization policies may override personal settings
		- ### How to Configure
			- **Web**: Settings → Codespaces → "Default idle timeout" → Save
			- **CLI**: `gh codespace create --idle-timeout 90m`
		- ### Important Notes
			- You are billed for entire duration codespace is active, regardless of use
			- Cannot prevent auto-stop entirely (max 4 hours)
			- Extended timeouts increase costs
	- ## Pricing & Billing
		- ### Compute Costs (per hour)
			- 2-core: $0.18/hour
			- 4-core: $0.36/hour
			- 8-core: $0.72/hour
			- 16-core: $1.44/hour
			- 32-core: $2.88/hour
			- Linear scaling: 16-core costs 8x more than 2-core
		- ### Storage Costs
			- $0.07 per GB-month
			- Applies to stopped codespaces
			- Time-based calculation of disk space used
		- ### Free Quotas (Personal Accounts Only)
			- **GitHub Free**: 120 hours compute + 15 GB-month storage
			- **GitHub Pro**: 180 hours compute + 20 GB-month storage
			- Organizations and enterprises have no free quota
			- Valid payment method required for usage beyond quota
	- ## Environment Variables
		- ### Codespace-Specific
			- `CODESPACE_NAME`: Name of the codespace
			- `CODESPACES`: Always `true` in a codespace
			- `GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN`: Port forwarding domain
		- ### GitHub Integration
			- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Authenticated token for API calls
			- `GITHUB_API_URL`: API endpoint URL
			- `GITHUB_GRAPHQL_URL`: GraphQL endpoint
			- `GITHUB_SERVER_URL`: GitHub server URL
			- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`: Owner and repository name
			- `GITHUB_USER`: User who initiated the codespace
		- ### Git Configuration
			- `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL`: Committer email
			- `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`: Committer name
		- **Note**: Environment variables are case-sensitive
	- ## Use Cases
		- ### Long-Running [[Claude Code]] Sessions
			- **Perfect for AFK coding sessions**: Codespace continues running after closing browser/editor
			- Cloud-based execution means local machine can be shut down or disconnected
			- Process continues until explicit stop or timeout (up to 4 hours)
			- **Recommended Configuration**:
				- Set timeout to maximum 240 minutes for long sessions
				- Use 4-core or 8-core machine for good performance
				- Monitor costs: 8-core at $0.72/hour = $2.88 for 4-hour session
				- Commit and push work regularly to avoid data loss
			- **Workflow**:
				- 1. Start codespace with extended timeout
				- 2. Launch [[Claude Code]] session
				- 3. Close browser/editor - session continues running
				- 4. Reconnect later to check progress
				- 5. Explicitly stop codespace when done to avoid charges
		- ### Team Collaboration
			- Standardized development environments for entire team
			- Instant onboarding for new team members
			- Configuration-as-code ensures consistency
		- ### Resource-Intensive Workloads
			- Machine learning with up to 32 cores and 128GB RAM
			- Large builds or compilations
			- Data processing tasks
		- ### Quick Prototyping
			- Test code from templates
			- Experiment without local setup
			- Try different configurations easily
