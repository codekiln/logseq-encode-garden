- [Lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) is made in the same spirit like Lazygit, and also gives you a terminal interface for managing your containers and images.
  
  You can start it with `Super + Shift + D`.
  
  You stop a container using `s` or start/restart it using `r`. See all commands using `?`.
