- # Idea - In Ableton, be able to quickly set the loop start and end braces to the start and end markers
	- ## Use Case
		- For some absurd reason, Ableton assumes that we always want to "quantize" loop braces to a warp marker defined at a specific BPM or to a specific bar line in the [[Ableton/Clip/View]]. The only alternative is to choose "Fixed Grid" as "Off" and then zoom in to an absurdly small interval to ensure that they match. This could easily be achieved with Max for Live.
