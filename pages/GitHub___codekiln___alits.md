				- [[GitHub/aptrn]]'s original template was for [[c74/max/standalone]], where there are [[c74/max/Project]]s that can manage the paths unique to each application so as to include each generated [[c74/max/js]] item.
				- I could add each library to the [[c74/max/File Browser]] path manually, which could work, but I have to be careful that each generated js file is uniquely named.
				- That doesn't seem like a great approach for portability or getting a great [[Dev/Experience]].
				- Instead, if we utilize [[rollupjs]] and [[Typescript]] options so everything is compiled to a file that's adjacent to the [[c74/M4L/.amxd]] file that's uniquely named, then the downstream developer won't have to mess with modifying [[c74/M4L/max]]'s  paths.

					- so far i know you need to open the project file in Max4Live.
					- Okay open Ableton, drag in an empty M4L device, click on the "old school chip" icon on the right of the device, opens M4L edit panel.

						- Hi Jeremy, for me, "Export Max for Live Device..." is greyed out, both when opening the amxd from Max or from Live. I did find a workflow using "freeze device" and "save as", that seems to do the trick. Are these equivalent?

									- Previous versions of Max used a single global search path for locating files used by the application. For instance, the "patches" folder inside the Max application folder was typically used to store patchers, media files, 3rd party externals and help files, and so on. Projects provide new means for controlling how Max searches for files.
									- Projects also maintain a list of additional folders to be searched when locating project assets. This list works similarly to the list found in Max's [[c74/max/Menu/Options/File Preferences]]  window, but is used only by the project.
										- #Insight #Observation *ok, so it sounds like [[c74/max/Project]]s are the only way to have project-specific paths added. So I either need to change the compilation directory for [[GitHub/aptrn/maxmsp-ts-library-template/apps/maxmsp-test]] so that the compiled assets are in the same directory as the patcher, similar to the way [[GitHub/zsteinkamp/m4l-typescript-base]] does it, or instruct users to add a folder manually to the search path using the File Preferences menu. The latter is not as ergonomic, because it will likely require additional set-up and reminders for users. However, it may be the fastest way for me to get going. Of course, it's at least POSSIBLE that if I save my [[c74/M4L/.amxd]] file in the parent directory of the generated typescript assets, I may be able to access the items via a relative path...*
						- #Conclusion no, there's no way to do something similar to [[c74/max/Project]]s in [[Ableton/Max for Live]]; I need to explore other approaches such as
							- 1 - using a relative path to a sub-directory
							- 2 - changing the [[Typescript/tsconfig]] compilation setting so that it compiles to the same directory as the [[c74/M4L/.amxd]] file

					- but if I were to create a new [[c74/M4L]] project in Ableton, I don't think that I'd know how to associate these. Are they automatically detected from the imports? in the inspector, upon selecting the [[c74/max/js]] `js Main` object, I see
						- ```json
						  {
						  "attributes" : 	{
						  "filepath" : [ "Macintosh HD:/Users/Me/Documents/GitHub/alits/apps/maxmsp-test/Patchers/Test.maxpat" ]
						  }
						  ```
					- I see [Projects | Cycling '74 Documentation](https://docs.cycling74.com/userguide/projects/) [[c74/max/Ref/Projects]]
						- ![project inspector](https://docs.cycling74.com/images/661d1b6f8cd0e7698a93d6cc90adf2d1_412.webp)
						- I see that number 4 above allows you to add dependencies to the project:
							- > Add files to Project: To add files to a project, they can be created from scratch, patchers can
							  be created from templates, and existing files can be added to projects.
						- That is greyed out for me, though, perhaps because I didn't start my trial?
						- #Discovered
							- [[c74/max/obj/node.script/Ref/Node for Max]]
								- In the Project Inspector **disable** the option "Keep Project Folder Organized" (**NOTE - NOT AS PICTURED, YOU NEED TO UNCHECK**)

								- You can now close the Project Inspector. We will now use the `+` Button in the bottom left corner in order to add our main patcher to the project by choosing "Add New File…" and creating a Max Patcher called `n4m-bundler.main.maxpat`
								- #Observation when I open the gear icon for [[c74/max/Project/Window]] I'm given the ability to choose between Project Inspector, Search Paths, Open Actions. When I do Search Paths, I can see a `project default` with path that includes has the `subfolders` checked. **I wonder if I could do this for max for live?**
								  id:: 67a89ce8-b922-4e9e-9f02-43cab5a93eb1
				- I see that the README from [[GitHub/aptrn/maxmsp-ts-example]] has a [Bundle Dependencies for Max](https://github.com/aptrn/maxmsp-ts-example?tab=readme-ov-file#bundle-dependencies-for-max) section
					- > You can install dependencies using `pnpm i -D <package-name>`. If you're sure the dependency is [**compatible with Max**](https://github.com/aptrn/maxmsp-ts-example?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies), you can add it to the config file.
					- > The configuration file `maxmsp.config.json` determines which dependencies are included in the compiled output. The default `output_path` is `lib`, placed as a subdirectory of the `outDir` found in the `tsconfig.json` file.

			- Ok, so the problem is that `turbo` - that is, [[turborepo]] - is not found inside the container.
				- I see that the [[Docker/Dockerfile]] has `CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]`,
					- [[GitHub/aptrn/maxmsp-ts-library-template]] mentions `pnpm`, but npm should work just as good
					- it's calling `turbo build`. we don't yet have turborepo installed
				- [[GitHub/zsteinkamp/m4l-typescript-base]] has this in the package.json/scripts/dev:
					- `yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn tsc --watch`
					- so we could probably do something similar, installing inside of the dev command. but that seems a bit wasteful, since docker build could do the installation for us.
				- #Discovered [[StackOverflow/How do I make pnpm work as intended in a vscode dev container?]] from [[2023/09]] which has significant debugging work needed to get [[pnpm]] working with [[VSCode/Dev Container]]s.
					- Conclusion: it's more trouble than it's worth. I was just trying to use pnpm because it was already baked into the template.
			- Struggled with this for a few more hours.
