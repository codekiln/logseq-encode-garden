		- > One major theme is Multi-Agent. Several of the tools you mentioned, such as Syncing Tools-as-Architect, Cursor Rules Architect, and Agentic Cursor Rules, all revolve around the idea that we can push AI performance further by splitting it into multiple specialized roles. This resonates strongly with some of my own experiments, which I wrote about [on my blog at yage.ai](https://yage.ai/multi-agent-en.html). In essence, even though an AI like Cursor can plan and execute code, it tends to get stuck if everything happens in one context. By separating out a Planner from an Executor—and by giving them a shared document for communication—we cut down on context confusion and let each agent focus on its specialty. From my own trials, a more powerful Planner (like an o1-level model) plus an Executor (like Claude or GPT) can handle more complex tasks without losing track of previously fixed bugs or big-picture goals. Of course, it introduces new quirks (like over-engineering), but it can also raise the overall quality of AI-driven development to a new level.
