	- This Performance presents an artistic research project exploring the performance of John Cage’s “Solo for Sliding Trombone” using AI generative tools within the Somax2 environment. The performance investigates the interplay between human interpretation, AI-assisted performance, and Cage’s core concepts of silence, indeterminacy, and unintentionality. By integrating AI agents as virtual performers and employing techniques like “coloring the silence” and “expansions,” the research aims to push the boundaries of Cage’s indeterminacy. This artistic research resulted in a unique set of improvised performances, captured and presented in a box set with 7 distinct tracks, showcasing the dynamic interplay between human and AI creativity within the framework of Cage’s innovative musical philosophy.
