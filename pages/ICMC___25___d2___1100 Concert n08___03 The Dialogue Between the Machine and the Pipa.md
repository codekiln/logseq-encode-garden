		- **The Dialogue Between the Machine and the Pipa** is an electronic music composition inspired by AI and brain science technologies. It presents a dynamic sensory experience through the movement and visual data of a robotic dog, combined with near-infrared brain functional imaging technology to generate electronic music voices. The piece also incorporates the melodic essence of the pipa to unfold a dialogue across time and space. The music is not merely a performance by a musician; it is an interaction within an intelligent ecosystem co-created by humans and machines. The composer hopes that this project represents not only technological advancement but also the continuation of human emotion and creativity. Under the guidance of technology, music becomes a bridge connecting the soul and the future. “Dialogue Between Pipa and Machine” sparks new possibilities in the realms of AI, brain science, and art creation.
