		- **Dynamic itineraries**, was composed in 2024. The aim of the work is to develop the timbric and spatial dimension through innovation.
			- To do this, trajectories are deployed in space with textural concepts.
			- The spatiality of sound will be considered based on the analytical approach proposed by Gary Kendall (2009).
			- Curiosity about the transformation of sound motivated the timbric treatment of this work. This approach allows the interpretation and study of the transformation of sound material and the disturbance of spatial schemes.
		- The acoustic parameters -physical and perceptual-, regardless of a specific architectural space, will allow to be used as a source of compositional structure generation. The sound creation of the work for electronic sounds will contemplate the “play” between the spatial location of the sound, the textural space and the interior field of the architectural structure through acoustics. The relationship between conceptual sources and acoustic environment analyzed based on cognitive content-container schemes (Kendall 2009): interplay forms/resources with perceptual grouping from the disruption between container-content schemes.
		- The organization of the speech will be based on the holophonic musical texture, developed by Panayiotis Kokoras. The composer expresses that he considers it as the next stage of evolution of the musical texture, continuing with the paradigms of monophony, polyphony and homophony. He thus also clarifies that the holophonic musical texture is not related to holophony as an acoustic reference to holography. He explains that the listener is focused on the synthesis of sound currents in simultaneous layers and their morphopoiesis over time. Panayiotis Kokoras with the concept of morphopoiesis refers to instrumental, vocal and electroacoustic music that focuses his interest on the internal and external attributes of sound through time. It alludes to a general procedure for structuring musical form and is mainly related to timbre. He details that morphopoiesis provides a principle whose objective is to identify and clarify a general procedure that provides an explanation of the relationship between content and form (Kokoras 2005).
