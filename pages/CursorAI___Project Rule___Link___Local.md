- # Cursor Local Project Rule Link
	- This is a link that will only function in a desktop computing environment. It will open the Project Rule file in Cursor locally, assuming that `cursor` is available as an executable configured so that a `cursor://` URI opens the specified file in cursor. The file will then be opened for editing.
	- ## Example from [[CursorAI/Project Rule/cursor-project-rule-editor.mdc]]
		- Code
			- ```markdown
			  [markdown-project-rule-editor.mdc (link only works to edit locally in cursor)](cursor://../.cursor/rules/cursor-project-rule-editor.mdc)
			  ```
		- Rendered
			- [markdown-project-rule-editor.mdc (link only works to edit locally in cursor)](cursor://../.cursor/rules/cursor-project-rule-editor.mdc)
