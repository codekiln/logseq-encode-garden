- # Cursor Local Project Rule Link
	- This is a link that will only function in a desktop computing environment. It will open the Project Rule file in Cursor locally, assuming that `cursor` is available as an executable configured so that a `cursor://` URI opens the specified file in cursor. The file will then be opened for editing.
	- ## Example
		- ```markdown
		  [markdown-project-rule-editor.mdc](cursor://../.cursor/rules/cursor-project-rule-editor.mdc)
		  ```
