- # The importance of #Balancing [[DIY Software Engineering]] and [[AI Coding]]
	- ## AI Development Phases and Building the Coding Engine
		- While working on [[AI/Coding/Technique/Phased Planning/ai-coding dir]], had a thought about [[AI Software Engineering]]
			- Feels like **building an engine—a coding engine**. [[Software/Engineering]] **is now the act of building and tuning a specific coding engine, tailored to a specific domain or problem**.
				- The engine consists of prompts meant to be invoked at specific phases in the software development lifecycle.
				- If done well, it could function like a checklist.
					- This could increase quality and consistency. [[Book/The Checklist Manifesto]].
	- ## Traversal and Resolution in Learning
		- Driving everywhere limits the ability of the traveler to notice details in the landscape.
		- Slower traversals increase the resolution of time, life, and awareness.
		- Agentic coding feels like driving—accelerated but less granular.
		- Before motor cars became common, people walked and biked more.
		- After cars, personal exploration of the landscape diminished.
		- Coding is approaching a similar shift, where implementation is rapid but potentially less thoughtful.
	- ## What is the right ratio of AI:DIY coding?
		- Implementing something from scratch yields a more detailed mental map.
		- [[Classical Software Engineering]] fosters struggle, which often leads to better abstractions and simplifications.
			- Without this struggle or the signal of felt pain, one may not recognize patterns that lead to cleaner designs.
		- It's not a fixed thing. It changes with the season, the repo, the project, the issue.
		- Cultivate mindfulness to tune into the signal of when the fulcrum needs to shift
