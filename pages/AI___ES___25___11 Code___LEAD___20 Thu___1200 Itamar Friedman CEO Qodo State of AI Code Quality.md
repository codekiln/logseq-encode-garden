	- ## Talk: The State of AI Code Quality: Hype vs. Reality [03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMSprbJ95jg&t=11532s) - Qodo (Itamar Friedman): Breaking the "Glass Ceiling" of Productivity with Agentic Quality
		- AI is making code generation nearly effortless, but the critical question remains: can we trust AI-generated code for software that truly matters? Has it really become easier to build robust, high-quality systems?
		- In this talk, we'll separate hype from reality. Drawing on the State of AI Code Quality report, we'll explore where AI tools excel, where they fall short, and which evaluation frameworks actually matter. We'll unpack benchmarks, pitfalls, and lessons learned from deploying AI in real-world engineering workflows. Attendees will leave with a clearer understanding of how to measure, trust, and improve both AI-generated code and AI-driven code review—and what's next for software quality in the age of AI.

	- ## Slide — Productivity vs. Investment (Take-away Trajectory)
		- **Axes**
			- Y-axis: **Productivity** (upward).
			- X-axis: **Investment** (rightward).
		- **Four stacked curves (bottom → top)**
			- **Code Gen** — lowest, slow early gain, flattens quickly.
			- **Agentic Code Gen** — higher slope, plateaus at a mid-level productivity ceiling.
			- **With Agentic Quality** — a further uplift once quality-focused agents enter the loop; reaches a higher but still bounded plateau.
			- **Learning System Focused on Quality** — steepest curve; diverges upward instead of flattening, showing compounding returns.
				- [[My Notes]]
					- this is the keyword here
		- **Visual narrative**
			- Left → right: as organizations invest, they move from simple generation → agentic behaviors → agentic quality → **self-improving, quality-centric systems**.
			- Only the top curve escapes the diminishing-returns ceiling.

	- ## Slide — The Catch and Crisis in Vibe Coding
		- **Left column (4-step failure dynamic)**
			- **More code** — AI accelerates raw output.
			- **More PRs** — throughput increases across teams.
			- **Not fewer bugs per LOC** — defect rate stays the same or worsens.
			- **Review can’t keep up** — code is produced faster than humans can evaluate.
		- **Right column (Faros velocity chart)**
			- Title: **AI boosts output, but human review becomes the bottleneck**.
			- Three bar metrics comparing low → high AI adoption:
				- **Task Throughput per Dev**: +21.4% (green).
				- **PR Merge Rate per Dev**: +97.8% (green).
				- **Median Review Time**: +91.1% (red).
			- Interpretation: productivity up → merge load up → review latency spikes.
		- **Overall insight**
			- The “vibe coding” surge creates a structural imbalance: generation scales, review does not.

		- **4. Testing**
			- Coverage gaps.
			- Edge cases proliferate with AI-scaled code volume.
		- **5. Deployment**
			- Code not scoped to environment variables correctly.
			- Breaking changes across dependencies.
		- **Visual organization**
			- Five rounded boxes arranged in a grid with slight stagger.
			- Represents the SDLC as a chain where AI pressure introduces cracks at each stage.

	- ## Slide — Code Review as Gateway & Gatekeeper
		- **Primary message (left block)**
			- Code review is both **gateway** (improves quality) and **gatekeeper** (governs process).
			- It operates at **two layers**:
				- *Code-level quality* (correctness, security, style).
				- *Process-level quality* (shared ownership, learning, standards).
		- **Supporting note**
			- Code review isn’t only about defect detection.
			- It enables the team to **own and learn the code together**.
		- **Right visual (screenshot)**
			- A PR Compliance Guide UI from Qodo:
				- Security checks, ticket compliance, duplication checks, custom compliance.
				- Color-coded indicators (green/yellow/red).
		- **Visual intent**
			- Left: conceptual framing.
			- Right: concrete example of structured, AI-supported review governance.\

	- ## Slide — Why is AI Code Review Important?
		- **Top framing**
			- AI code review yields **more productivity** and **higher quality** simultaneously.
		- **Two highlight cards (centered)**
			- **2×** — AI code review delivers **double the quality gain**.
			- **47%** — Developers are **47% more productive** when AI participates in review.
		- **Visual emphasis**
			- Two bright purple rectangles side-by-side to signal paired benefits: *quality ↑ + productivity ↑*.

	-
	- ## Slide — Software Development Gen-3.5+
		- **Framing**
			- Context-aware, multi-agent, “System II” intelligence.
			- A *second brain* for dev orgs: human + a swarm of specialized agents.
		- **Core triad (right diagram)**
			- Three nodes in constant circulation:
				- **Spec** (purple assistant circle)
				- **Tests** (white assistant circle)
				- **Implement** (deep purple assistant circle)
			- Each node surrounded by **blue agent nodes**.
				- Agents run in parallel, revising, cross-checking, and enriching each artifact.
			- Arrows show **continuous bidirectional flow**:
				- Spec ⇄ Tests
				- Tests ⇄ Implement
				- Implement ⇄ Spec
				- Each loop has inner micro-loops where agents refine details.
		- **Bottom inputs**
			- **Env**, **SW DB**, **Tools** — infrastructure feeding real-time context.
		- **Narrative intent**
			- This is his long-term thesis:
				- Future dev = human creativity + persistent agentic refinement across spec, code, and tests.
				- Multiple agents operate concurrently, not sequentially—turning engineering into a *parallelized, iterative, always-learning* system.

	- ### Demo - rigorous rules
		- [[My Notes]]
			- one of the examples of rules was that a todo was in the code without an issue link and person responsible
