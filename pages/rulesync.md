	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- [[2025-09-29 Mon]]
			- I tried running it in [[Person/codekiln/GitHub/logseq-cursor-rules]] in the root directory with ` rulesync import --targets cursor` and it didn't load any, because they were in the root of the directory. There's a [[GitHub/Issue]] for this here: [rulesync import ignores subdirectories in .cursor/rules Â· Issue #56 Â· dyoshikawa/rulesync](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/issues/56).
			- I also tried running it in [[GitHub/codekiln/logseq-encode-garden]], which did have non-nested [[CursorAI/Project Rules]], but it did not import any rules, as far as I can tell, nor did it output any debug information.
			- As a result, I think this project is of limited utility at this time.
			- I filed [[GitHub/Issue]] [rulesync import --targets cursor does not import .cursor/rules/*.mdc Â· Issue #328 Â· dyoshikawa/rulesync](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/issues/328)
