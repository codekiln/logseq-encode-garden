- [Dark Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern)
	- **Dark patterns** (also called "deceptive patterns") = user interface designs that intentionally mislead or manipulate users into doing things they didn't really want to do—often benefiting the business instead of the user. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern))
	- **Term history:**
		- **[[2/0/1/0]] (coined):** UX designer [[Person/Harry Brignull]] coined **"dark patterns"** (via darkpatterns.org, now rebranded as deceptive.design) to label interface designs that trick people into actions they wouldn't otherwise choose with full understanding. ([Medium](https://harrybr.medium.com/bringing-dark-patterns-to-light-d86f24224ebf))
		- **[[2/0/1/0/s]]–present (research + governance lens):** "Dark patterns" became a major topic in HCI research and policy discussions, increasingly framed as **deceptive choice architecture**—often using the same behavioral levers as [[Design/Persuasive]], but aimed at outcomes that primarily benefit the business over the user. ([ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3581258))
	- **Relationship to persuasive design:**
		- Dark patterns sit on the manipulative end of the [[Design/Persuasive]] spectrum
		- They exploit cognitive biases (urgency, default bias, fear of missing out) to push users toward decisions that primarily benefit the business
		- Unlike ethical persuasive design, dark patterns prioritize business outcomes over user autonomy and understanding
