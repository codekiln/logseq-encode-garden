- # [Introducing Showboat and Rodney, so agents can demo what they've built](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/10/showboat-and-rodney/)
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- [[Person/Simon Willison]] introduces two new CLI tools focused on agent demonstration workflows.
		- [[GitHub/simonw/showboat]] turns terminal session recordings into videos so coding agents can produce reproducible demos of what they built.
		- [[GitHub/simonw/rodney]] gives agents a browser automation path via Chrome DevTools so they can operate a real browser, not just take static screenshots.
		- This feels like a practical extension of the broader shift toward agent-first developer tooling: less "describe what happened", more "show the run artifact".
	- ## Highlights
		- Showboat: CLI for turning terminal recordings into demo videos.
		- Rodney: CLI bridge for agent control of Chrome via DevTools.
		- Both tools are framed as practical infrastructure for AI coding demos and interactive validation.
