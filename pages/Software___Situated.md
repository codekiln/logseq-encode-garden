- # Situated Software
	- A concept first proposed by [[Person/Clay Shirky]] in 2004, defined as software "designed in and for a particular social situation or context"
	- ## Definition
		- Software designed for a specific social context or situation
		- Applications that could be used by dozens of users rather than thousands or millions
		- Communities would get very form-fit tools for their particular needs, rather than trying to adapt generic software
		- Focused on solving local problems for specific communities
	- ## Historical Context
		- First proposed by [[Person/Clay Shirky]] in 2004
		- [[Person/Clay Shirky]] was ahead of his time - it was practically impossible to build this small-scale software in 2004
		- The technology and tools weren't accessible enough for most people to create situated software at that time
		- Sixteen years later, in 2020, Robin Sloan's "An App Can Be a Home-Cooked Meal" picked up on similar themes
	- ## Characteristics
		- Designed for small, specific communities (dozens of users)
		- Form-fit to particular needs rather than generic solutions
		- Context-specific and situation-aware
		- Local and community-oriented
