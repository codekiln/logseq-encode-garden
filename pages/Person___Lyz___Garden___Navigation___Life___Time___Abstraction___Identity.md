	- ## Quotes
		- ### Intro
			- An [identity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_%28social_science%29) is the set of qualities, beliefs, personality traits, appearance, and/or expressions that characterize a person or a group.
			- acts as a "self-regulatory structure" that provides meaning, direction, and a sense of self-control
				- profoundly influences an individual's capacity to adapt to life events
				- originates from traits or attributes that you may have little or no control over, such as their family background or ethnicity
			- Identities then will be the guide of my life
				- I can split myself in many identities each with it's definition and analyse life through the different lenses, identify identity conflicts, priorize identities...
				- I can analyse each identity on it's own, decide how to change my roadmap to integrate the ones I want to adopt and get away from the ones I want to leave behind.
				- It reminds me of the RPG character building and although it may seem silly, that motivates me.
