	- ## Quotes
		- ### Intro
			- An [identity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_%28social_science%29) is the set of qualities, beliefs, personality traits, appearance, and/or expressions that characterize a person or a group.
			- acts as a "self-regulatory structure" that provides meaning, direction, and a sense of self-control
				- profoundly influences an individual's capacity to adapt to life events
				- originates from traits or attributes that you may have little or no control over, such as their family background or ethnicity
			- Identities then will be the guide of my life
				- I can split myself in many identities each with it's definition and analyse life through the different lenses, identify identity conflicts, priorize identities...
				- I can analyse each identity on it's own, decide how to change my roadmap to integrate the ones I want to adopt and get away from the ones I want to leave behind.
				- It reminds me of the RPG character building and although it may seem silly, that motivates me.

			- # Logseq Example in Orgmode Style (Lyz’s System)
			- Below is an Orgmode snippet showing how Hermione Granger might model her Identities and Axis using the structure from Lyz’s Blue Book. This follows the Org headings, property drawers, and linking conventions demonstrated at [https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/orgmode/](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/orgmode/).
