- # [Ableton Live Keyboard Shortcuts](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/11/live-keyboard-shortcuts/) that utilize a single letter
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- [[2025-05-13 Tue]] assembled this list so as to find the keys that are free for quick mapping with the [Key Map Mode Switch - see also 29.2.5 Computer Keyboard Remote Control](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/11/midi-and-key-remote-control/#computer-keyboard-remote-control) in the [[Ableton/Manual/29/02/05 Computer Keyboard Remote Control]].
			- Specifically, I was looking for good default shortcuts for [[Ableton/Manual/06/03 Launching the Arrangement with Locators]]
