- # How to set up the [BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD) in a [[ChatGPT/Project]]
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- ### Setting up the AI agents
		  collapsed:: true
			- 1 - create a new ChatGPT project. Name it after the project you are developing. For me this was [[GitHub/codekiln/ableton-live-git-hooks]]
			- 2 - for the [[ChatGPT/Project/Instruction]] use [BMAD-METHOD/web-build-sample/agent-prompt.txt](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/web-build-sample/agent-prompt.txt)
			- 3 - for the [[ChatGPT/Project/Files]] attach all the files in the [web-build-sample ](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/tree/main/web-build-sample) dir except for the [agent-prompt.txt](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/web-build-sample/agent-prompt.txt) used in step 2
		- ### Start using the AI agents
		  collapsed:: true
			- At this point, start a new conversation in the ChatGPT Project describing what you want to build. For me this was a [[Repomix/Bundle]] file with all the source code and docs I already had, and a simple message.
			- [[ChatGPT/Query]]
				- > I've attached my work in progress on this project. I need your help setting up the required documentation and working out the architecture. please guide me through the process
			- [[ChatGPT/Response]]
				- Hello! I’m BMad, your Agile AI Orchestrator, here to help you assemble the right specialist for setting up your documentation and architecture. Below are the available agents and their main tasks:

					- Brain Storming

				- Which agent would you like to activate, and is there a specific task you want them to start with? (You can also choose an interaction mode: **Interactive** or **YOLO** batch-mode.)
			- At this point, I wasn't totally certain where to start. I looked at the [workflow-diagram.md](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/docs/workflow-diagram.md) and it started with Phase 0. Business Analyst, so I activated **Analyst (Mary)**:
			- [[ChatGPT/Query]]
				- > I'd like to activate the analyst
		- ### Using [[Person/Brian Madison/BMAD/Persona/Analyst]]
			- #### [[ChatGPT/Response]]
			  collapsed:: true
				- **Mary (Analyst)** here – your strategic ideation partner and research guide. I’m a bit of a know-it-all and love to verbalize and emote as if I were sitting right beside you.
				- **Available Tasks:**
					- **Brain Storming** – generate and explore ideas creatively.
					- **Deep Research** – collaboratively craft a targeted research prompt.
					- **Project Briefing** – assemble a structured Project Brief using the `project-brief-tmpl`.
				- I’ll assume **Interactive** mode unless you tell me to go YOLO. How would you like to get started? You can pick one of my tasks or describe what you need.
