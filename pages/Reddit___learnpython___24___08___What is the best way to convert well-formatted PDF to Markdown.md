		- I want to convert a well-formatted PDF file (text, not scanned) to Markdown or plain text. What is the best library for that?
		- Googling doesn't offer much help, and results using AI OCR come up. But I don't need that.
		- I will need to work with PDF files that are in English, and are well formatted. I need Markdown as output. Even plaintext is okay.
		- How do I achieve this?
		- AI chatbots suggest a pipeline of [[pdfplumber]], [[beautifulsoup]], [[Markdownify]]
		- Is this the best way?
		- What would you suggest?
