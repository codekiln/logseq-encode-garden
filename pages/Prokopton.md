			- προκόπτον.
			- But be aware that if you're planning on getting this for a tattoo or something, **it doesn't mean "One who is progressing."** It's not actually a noun at all, but a participle, and the above is the neuter version, not the masculine.
			- as a verb it's in the past tense, "**I was progressing**."
			- if you use the participle version as a noun, it'd be something more like "**this thing that's progressing**."
			- If you're a male looking for something that says "**Someone progressing**," then you want προκόπτων. If you're a female, προκόπτουσα.
			- If you're looking for something more like "**progress on a journey**," then it's προκοπή.
			- If you want just "**I am progressing**" then it's προκόπτω.
			- Also be aware that if you are in fact asking for tattoo purposes that "προκόπτω" **only means "I progress" metaphorically**, but **literally means "cutting your way forward,"** so putting it on your forearm would probably be a bad idea.
