- [Planned Obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence)
	- Planned obsolescence = **intentionally shortening a product’s useful life** (or making it feel outdated sooner) to encourage replacement and repeat sales. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence))
	- **Term history (very short):**
		- **1932 (named explicitly):** Bernard London’s pamphlet *Ending the Depression Through Planned Obsolescence* argued that shortening product lifetimes could stimulate economic demand during the Great Depression. ([Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/London_%281932%29_Ending_the_depression_through_planned_obsolescence.pdf))
		- **1925–1939 (often-cited early example):** The **Phoebus cartel** in incandescent lightbulbs is widely cited as an industrial case where lifespan was standardized downward (often to ~1,000 hours), making it a classic planned-obsolescence story. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebus_cartel))
		- **1954 (popularized in design/marketing):** Industrial designer **Brooks Stevens** framed planned obsolescence as “instilling in the buyer the desire to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary.” ([Industrial Designers Society of America](https://www.idsa.org/innovation_article/pivot-or-obsolescence/))
		- **Late 1950s–1960s (turns into critique):** Public backlash grew, and planned obsolescence became linked to “throwaway” consumer culture and manipulation-by-marketing critiques. ([daily.jstor.org](https://daily.jstor.org/the-birth-of-planned-obsolescence/))
