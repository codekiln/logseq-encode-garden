		- fluttery, dark. the box is big, made out of wood, with all these pots, no description given for this one. it's intriguing, that's for sure.
		- it's noisy, not uninteresting, but not totally grabbing me by the collar, either.
		- some fluttering between the stereo field is filled with jiggling.
		- some of the lower phase strangeness is pleasing to me.
		- "fish" sounds. scribblings and inner illogic. sections of pseudo tonality.
		- grey noise, with some volcanic rock pumice acid burning rain corrugated tin.
		- like a geiger counter. reminds me of that ligeti piece with metronomes.
		- we have some spatiality now, deeper in, where crushed a rainbow crystal slot machine jingles.
		- it's all very front of the tongue, bouncing right on the surface. there is backgoround and staging, but not as many layers as some pieces.
		- my head does bobble a bit.
		- ok, there's more juice in this grumbling flibber than I thought at first, give me more of what he's having.
		- i see now that this really does come from the true spirit of teenage engineering.
		- let's see wtf this does. listen like a geologist.

			- **Cryptwarbler** circuit-bent Casio MT-240 homemade controllers
				- ==the sounds of corrupted data are exposed==
				- woven into bizarre digital tapestries
			- connecting ROM-CPU lines, program & instruction data are rerouted
				- superimposed in a very analog way
			- The result is a radical, whimsical departure from normal operation
				- glitched sounds, textures, and effects, each with their own unique intrigues and inherent limitations. Cryptwarbler’s compositional method embraces this unique relationship between performer and circuit-bent instrument: exploring a sound’s attributes while navigating its electrical constraints. Alex Bernhardt, the composer/tinkerer behind Cryptwarbler, has been exploring the MT-240 since 2019, building, researching, experimenting, investigating, and he hopes that others see the potential of circuit-bending from this approach.
