- #Website [Ranger Liu - About](https://ryurongliu.com/about)
	- > RANGER LIU (they/them) is an artist and astrophysicist interested in the communicative nature of abstract structures when combined with sound. Their work uses theoretical frameworks such as math, astronomy, physics, and linguistics to develop physical processes for data-based sonic and/or sculptural composition. They frequently use their lived experience as a queer & trans Chinese-American as "source material" for these compositions, producing autotheoretic works halfway between data sonification/visualization and traditional composition. They hold BAs from Columbia University in Astrophysics and Computer Science and an MFA in Design & Technology from Parsons School of Design.
	- > They are classically trained in piano and can get by on the guitar, bass, ukulele, and drums. In their free time, you can find them solving Rubik's Cubes, bouldering, and reading sci-fi.
