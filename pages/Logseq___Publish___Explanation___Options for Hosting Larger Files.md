# Options for Hosting Large Media Files on a Logseq GitHub Pages Site
- ## Background: Logseq Publishing and Large Files
	- Publishing a Logseq site via GitHub Pages is a convenient way to share notes, but it poses challenges when including large media files (audio 20–80 MB, videos 50–700 MB, images 7–35 MB). GitHub imposes strict file size limits and GitHub Pages does not natively support Git LFS (Large File Storage) for serving assets. This means large files must be handled carefully to avoid exceeding Git limits or incurring performance issues. Below we explore several options for hosting these larger files, considering cost, setup effort, and privacy.
- ## Using Git LFS on GitHub Pages
	- Git LFS is an extension for Git that replaces large files in your repository with lightweight pointers, storing the actual content in a separate storage. It integrates into your Git workflow, allowing version control for large files without bloating the repository [Efficiently manage large files in Git with Git LFS](https://blog.logrocket.com/efficiently-manage-large-files-git-with-git-lfs/#:~:text=Git%20LFS%2C%20on%20the%20other,and%20reference%20them%20via%20pointers) [Benefits of managing large files with Git LFS](https://blog.logrocket.com/efficiently-manage-large-files-git-with-git-lfs/#:~:text=Benefits%20of%20managing%20large%20files,with%20Git%20LFS). **Pros:** Setup is straightforward and keeps media in the same repo. It allows collaborative versioning of media and uses GitHub's infrastructure, avoiding external services [Different version control tool](https://blog.logrocket.com/efficiently-manage-large-files-git-with-git-lfs/#:~:text=,a%20different%20version%20control%20tool) [Earlier versions if necessary](https://blog.logrocket.com/efficiently-manage-large-files-git-with-git-lfs/#:~:text=,to%20earlier%20versions%20if%20necessary). **Cons:** Git LFS has storage and bandwidth caps: each account gets 1 GB storage and 1 GB/month bandwidth free [About storage and bandwidth usage](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage#:~:text=Every%20account%20using%20Git%20Large,additional%20quota%20for%20Git%20LFS). Exceeding 1 GB/month download bandwidth will disable LFS until the next month (unless you purchase more) [Bandwidth quota](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage#:~:text=Bandwidth%20quota) [Account until next month](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage#:~:text=If%20you%20use%20more%20than,account%20until%20the%20next%20month). A single 700 MB video viewed just twice could hit this limit. GitHub also blocks normal Git pushes over 100 MB, meaning large files *must* use LFS.
	- **GitHub Pages limitations:** GitHub Pages does not directly serve LFS content – if you push an LFS pointer, the published site won't retrieve the file. In fact, Pages has no built-in support for LFS [GitHub Community Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50337#:~:text=). The workaround is to use GitHub Actions to fetch LFS files at build time and include them in the published site. GitHub now supports deploying Pages via Actions, so by enabling `lfs: true` in the checkout step, the action downloads the real files [GitHub Community Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50337#:~:text=2,but%20they%20are%20also%20here) [Standard deployment](https://blog.logrocket.com/efficiently-manage-large-files-git-with-git-lfs/#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20standard%20deployment,a%20page%20without%20any%20assets). This allows large files to be present in the static site output (bypassing the LFS pointer issue). However, **be mindful**: if a file exceeds 100 MB, even the Pages artifact may violate GitHub's limits if it were to be stored in a branch. Using the Actions deploy mechanism (which uploads the site via an API rather than a git push) might bypass the 100 MB git limit, but extremely large files could still pose problems or slow deployments.
	- **Cost and privacy:** Beyond the free tier, Git LFS requires purchasing data packs (e.g. $5 per 50 GB) for additional storage or bandwidth. If your site is low traffic, you might stay within the 1 GB/month free bandwidth, but any spike (e.g. a few people downloading a 700 MB video) would require additional bandwidth quota [Bandwidth quota](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage#:~:text=Bandwidth%20quota) [Account until next month](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage#:~:text=If%20you%20use%20more%20than,account%20until%20the%20next%20month). Privacy-wise, files in a public GitHub repository (or served via Pages) are accessible to anyone with the URL; there's no difference in privacy between hosting via GitHub vs. an external host since the site is public. One consideration is that using Git LFS means your large files are stored on GitHub's servers (and served from GitHub's CDN if included in Pages), which you may or may not trust for personal content. In general, if you prefer an all-in-one solution and your media usage is modest, Git LFS with a proper Pages Action can work, but it's not cost-effective for large videos or heavy traffic due to the strict quotas.
- ## Cloudflare R2: Object Storage or CDN?
	- Cloudflare R2 is a relatively new object storage service that is S3-compatible. **Is R2 a CDN or just storage?** R2 is essentially "object storage" (a drop-in S3 replacement) [R2 is an object store](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33009748#:~:text=R2%20is%20an%20object%20store,in%20replacement%20to%20S3). By itself, R2 stores objects in a chosen region. However, when integrated with Cloudflare's network (by using a custom domain or Cloudflare Worker), the content can be cached and delivered via Cloudflare's CDN edges [CDN included if you use managed subdomain](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1ijzywl/does_cloudflare_cdn_add_extra_cost_over/#:~:text=CDN%20is%20included%20if%20you,managed%20subdomain) [Cloudflare CDN discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1ijzywl/does_cloudflare_cdn_add_extra_cost_over/#:~:text=suoigerge). In practice, R2 is best thought of as storage with **optionally** CDN-like delivery when configured correctly. Cloudflare's documentation clarifies that if you expose an R2 bucket through a custom domain (using Cloudflare DNS/proxy), you can enable the Cloudflare Cache and other features to accelerate it [Production use cases](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#:~:text=,production%20use%20cases) [Development URL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#:~:text=To%20use%20features%20like%20WAF,development%20url). If you use the default `*.r2.dev` bucket URL (meant for development/testing), you **do not** get caching or advanced features [Development URL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#:~:text=To%20use%20features%20like%20WAF,development%20url) [Development URL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#:~:text=To%20use%20features%20like%20WAF,development%20url). So, R2 itself is not automatically a multi-node CDN – you must use Cloudflare's services on top of it.
	- For a small personal site, Cloudflare R2's appeal is its pricing model: **zero egress fees**. You pay for storage (approximately $0.015/GB-month) and operations (API requests), but downloading data to users is free [In other words](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33009748#:~:text=In%20other%20words%2C%20in%20a,that%20is%20not%20the%20case) [Free forever tier](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33009748#:~:text=That%20same%201g%20of%20storage,in%20the%20free%20forever%20tier). R2 also has an extremely generous free tier (e.g. millions of operations per month free) such that a low-traffic site is unlikely to incur any charge [1 million requests per month](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33009748#:~:text=To%20eat%20up%20the%20%244,1%20million%20requests%20per%20month). This makes hosting large videos or audio files financially attractive compared to S3 or GitHub LFS (which meter bandwidth). **Latency considerations:** Because R2 stores data in one region (you can choose a region closest to your expected audience), the first request for an object will come from that region. Subsequent requests *can* be served from Cloudflare's cache if you use a custom domain and set caching rules. However, note that Cloudflare's cache by default won't cache very large files (over ~512 MB) [Without added cost or complexity](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1c0i02c/cloudflare_r2_is_not_actually_cheap_like/#:~:text=,without%20added%20cost%20or%20complexity). In other words, a 700 MB video might not be cached at edge locations, meaning each viewer could be pulling it from the R2 origin. This is still free in terms of cost, but could mean higher latency for distant users on initial load. If your audience is geographically distributed and the content is frequently accessed, this is a slight drawback of R2 versus a true CDN with multi-region storage. (Cloudflare R2 is reportedly working on or implying geo-replication, but as of now the data is stored in a single location until cached on demand [Without added cost or complexity](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1c0i02c/cloudflare_r2_is_not_actually_cheap_like/#:~:text=,without%20added%20cost%20or%20complexity).)
	- **Cloudflare CDN integration and cost:** If you have a custom domain for your Logseq site (or you can use a subdomain), you can set up that domain on Cloudflare and point it to R2. Cloudflare will then cache your R2 content globally by default without extra fees [CDN included if you use managed subdomain](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1ijzywl/does_cloudflare_cdn_add_extra_cost_over/#:~:text=CDN%20is%20included%20if%20you,managed%20subdomain) [Cloudflare CDN discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1ijzywl/does_cloudflare_cdn_add_extra_cost_over/#:~:text=suoigerge). There is no additional cost for using Cloudflare's CDN on the free plan; you pay only for R2 storage/operations. This means effectively you get a globally distributed delivery for no egress cost. *However*, be mindful of Cloudflare's Terms of Service: the free CDN plan is not meant for serving mostly large media files (they don't want people building a video streaming service on the free tier) [Video chunks over their CDN](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1i5pfzn/cloudflare_r2_vs_bunnycdn_for_reducing_storage/#:~:text=Make%20sure%20that%20whatever%20you%27re,video%20chunks%20over%20their%20CDN) [Cloudflare discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1i5pfzn/cloudflare_r2_vs_bunnycdn_for_reducing_storage/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2). For a personal site with occasional media downloads, this is usually fine. Just ensure your usage is low-volume and primarily for personal/website content. Cloudflare's network has huge capacity and for occasional downloads of your videos or audio, it should perform well.
	- **Summary of Cloudflare R2 for Logseq site:** R2 can be an excellent solution to offload large files. You would upload your media to an R2 bucket, then reference them in your Logseq pages via a URL. The simplest approach is to set the bucket to public and use the `https://<accountid>.r2.dev/bucketname/yourfile` URL for each asset. For production use, consider using a custom domain (e.g. `media.yourdomain.com`) mapped to the R2 bucket for better caching and control [Production use cases](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#:~:text=,production%20use%20cases) [Development URL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#:~:text=To%20use%20features%20like%20WAF,development%20url). In either case, your Logseq site's Markdown or HTML can reference the asset URL directly. The user's browser will fetch from Cloudflare's nearest cache (if available) or from the R2 store. Given a low-traffic personal site, R2's free tier likely covers your needs entirely, making it cost-effective. Just remember the initial fetch latency if not cached, and the 512 MB caching limit (which mainly affects very large videos). Cloudflare R2's privacy is comparable to other cloud storage – your files are hosted on Cloudflare's servers (which are globally distributed and secured). If your content is not sensitive, this should be fine. If you require encryption at rest or more control, R2 supports server-side encryption as well.
- ## Other Low-Cost Object Storage and CDN Solutions
	- Beyond Cloudflare R2, there are several alternative storage/CDN providers that can fit a low-budget, low-traffic scenario:
	- **Backblaze B2:** Backblaze B2 is an object storage service known for its low storage cost (about $0.005/GB-month) and it's part of the *Bandwidth Alliance*. Notably, B2 charges no egress fees when you serve data through Cloudflare's network [Migrate objects to Backblaze](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1i5pfzn/cloudflare_r2_vs_bunnycdn_for_reducing_storage/#:~:text=Migrate%20your%20objects%20to%20Backblaze,CloudFlare%20CDN%20to%20front%20it) [Cloudflare discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1i5pfzn/cloudflare_r2_vs_bunnycdn_for_reducing_storage/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2). In practice, you can store your files in a B2 bucket and use Cloudflare as a proxy CDN (similar to using R2). B2's free tier offers 10 GB of storage and 1 GB/day of free download, and beyond that B2's egress fees are modest ($0.01/GB) – but if Cloudflare is fronting it, egress from B2 to Cloudflare is free. This combo is effectively similar to R2's no-egress model. B2 may be slightly cheaper for storage (and their pricing includes some free egress even without Cloudflare, up to 3× your storage as noted by Backblaze [Changed pricing last](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1c0i02c/cloudflare_r2_is_not_actually_cheap_like/#:~:text=We%20changed%20our%20pricing%20last,and%20transactions%20into%20the%20cost)). The trade-off is complexity: you'd need a Backblaze account and a Cloudflare domain configuration. If you already have a Cloudflare setup (for R2 or your site), adding B2 as origin is doable. For a personal site with <10 GB of media, B2 could end up essentially free. You can also serve directly from B2's own URLs, but then egress would cost money – so it's best used with a Cloudflare (or another CDN) in front for zero-cost delivery.
	- **Bunny.net (BunnyCDN and Bunny Storage):** Bunny.net is a popular low-cost CDN provider that also offers *Bunny Storage* (a storage zone that integrates with their CDN). You can upload your files to a Bunny storage zone and have them served via Bunny's global CDN. Bunny's pricing is pay-as-you-go: e.g. $0.01/GB storage in a single region, and CDN bandwidth starting around $0.01/GB (depending on region, with lower rates for North America/Europe and a bit higher for Asia) – with no monthly minimums beyond a $1 minimum account balance. For very low traffic, you might only spend a few cents. Bunny allows you to choose geo-replication for storage (e.g. have your files stored in both US and EU), which means the first byte latency can be lower for users in those regions (Bunny will fetch from the nearest storage copy). Bunny's CDN caching is also very effective, and unlike Cloudflare free, Bunny **is** explicitly happy to serve videos or large files (since you're paying for bandwidth). Bunny was even mentioned to have zero-cost internal egress with Backblaze B2 as well [JDBall55](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1i5pfzn/cloudflare_r2_vs_bunnycdn_for_reducing_storage/#:~:text=JDBall55) (they too are in the Bandwidth Alliance), so one could mix and match (though if you use Bunny's own storage, that's not needed). The **cons** of Bunny for an individual: it's not "free" (you'll have to maintain a prepaid balance, though small), and it's an extra external service to set up. Also, some users note Bunny's support or certain features may not be as robust as larger providers (one Reddit user noted slow support for a cache invalidation bug [Cloudflare discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1i5pfzn/cloudflare_r2_vs_bunnycdn_for_reducing_storage/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2) [Clear all of cache](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1i5pfzn/cloudflare_r2_vs_bunnycdn_for_reducing_storage/#:~:text=The%20bug%3F%20Clear%20all%20of,shoveled%20it%20off%20to%20engineering)). For a simple use-case like static file hosting, Bunny is usually very reliable and straightforward. You could either use Bunny's storage or even point Bunny CDN to a Backblaze B2 bucket or to your GitHub Pages site as origin. But using it as an origin for large files on GH Pages (which might be slow or limited) is less ideal – better to use a proper storage for the origin.
	- **Wasabi:** Wasabi is another object storage service known for no egress fees and a flat pricing of roughly `$5.99` per TB-month of storage. Wasabi's model is optimized for large, stable storage (they have a 90-day minimum retention: if you delete a file sooner, you still pay for 90 days) [WordPress backups](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1c0i02c/cloudflare_r2_is_not_actually_cheap_like/#:~:text=just%20need%20it%20for%20WordPress,backups). For a small personal site with only a few tens of GB at most, Wasabi's minimum charges (they often round up to at least 1 TB or so) make it less attractive – you'd likely pay ~`$6`/month even if you only store 50 GB or 100 GB. Also, Wasabi doesn't have a native CDN; you would still use something like Cloudflare in front if you want global caching. Cloudflare can indeed proxy Wasabi, but at that point, R2 or B2 are simpler. Wasabi's strength is unlimited free egress on their side, but since Cloudflare already provides that for B2 or R2, Wasabi doesn't add much benefit unless you have huge volumes of data to store very cheaply and lots of egress (which doesn't match "individual low traffic site"). In short, Wasabi is likely overkill for this scenario – it's better suited for backup storage or cases where you need to serve a lot of data consistently (and even then, their terms expect you not to repeatedly read the entire storage constantly).
	- **Other providers:** The Reddit discussion on this topic also mentioned *IDrive e2* and *Telnyx*. IDrive e2 is an S3-compatible storage with very low prices (sometimes ~$4/TB-month) and no ingress/egress fees (they follow a similar model to Wasabi). It could be a cheap option, but some users report the support is poor and reliability is unproven [Cloudflare discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1c0i02c/cloudflare_r2_is_not_actually_cheap_like/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2) [Yes I know and I am using it](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1c0i02c/cloudflare_r2_is_not_actually_cheap_like/#:~:text=Yes%20I%20know%20and%20I,am%20using%20it). Telnyx is less mainstream as a storage provider (primarily known for telecom APIs), but they launched an object storage with a generous free tier. These could be options if you're adventurous, but given the strong free/low-cost choices above, they may not be necessary. Another option is to use generic cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) with a CDN: e.g. Amazon S3 + CloudFront or Azure Blob + Azure CDN, but these tend to be far more expensive for egress (unless you fall in a free tier) and thus not ideal for a cost-sensitive personal site.
	- **Relevance to Logseq + GitHub Pages:** All the external storage solutions above (R2, B2, Bunny, Wasabi, etc.) can be used alongside GitHub Pages. The pattern is the same: you upload your large media files to the storage/CDN, and in your Logseq content you use an absolute URL to embed or link them (rather than trying to store them in the GitHub repo). This keeps your GitHub repository lean and avoids LFS bandwidth issues. For example, you might have in your Logseq markdown: `![](https://your-cdn.example.com/path/to/image.png)` for an image, or use an HTML `<audio src="https://...">` or `<video>` tag to reference the externally hosted media. GitHub Pages will happily serve the site with those external links. The content itself (the notes, pages) remain small text files in the repo, and the media loads from the object storage/CDN when a user views the page.
- ## Referencing Files with Object Storage URLs (Hashed or Direct)
	- One advantage of using object storage for your media is that you don't need pretty or human-readable URLs – you can let the storage service assign a unique URL or use a content-hash in the filename for cache busting without worrying about it. Since the Logseq site content will contain hyperlinks or embeds to these assets, the end user typically doesn't see the full URL anyway (for instance, an embedded image or audio player doesn't show the link). This means you can use whatever naming scheme is convenient or even just use the object's ID from the storage.
	- **Hashed filenames for caching:** If you plan to replace an asset with a new version occasionally, consider including a hash or version in its filename or path. For example, instead of `intro-video.mp4`, you could name it `intro-video-abc123.mp4` where `abc123` is a short hash of the content. This ensures that when you update the video, you also update the link in your Logseq page to a new URL, so browsers and CDNs won't mistakenly use an old cached version. (This technique is common in static site deployments to leverage cache indefinitely for content that doesn't change.) If using R2 or B2, you have full control over object names, so you can implement this easily. If using a service like Bunny's storage, you also control file names. Essentially, treat your large files as immutable once uploaded; if you need to update them, give the updated file a new name. Since you don't have to maintain a user-friendly URL structure, this approach is simple and effective.
	- **No need for custom domain (unless you want):** For a personal site, it's not required to serve assets from your own domain. Using the storage provider's URL (like `f002.backblazeb2.com/file/yourbucket/filename` or the R2 `*.r2.dev` link) is perfectly fine if you don't mind the slightly odd-looking URL. This might even have privacy benefits (no direct association with your custom domain in the asset URL, though security-wise it's equivalent). However, using a custom domain has advantages: you can later switch storage providers by updating DNS, and you can enable HTTPS and caching rules in one place. Cloudflare R2 in particular encourages custom domain usage to unlock CDN caching [Production use cases](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#:~:text=,production%20use%20cases) [Development URL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#:~:text=To%20use%20features%20like%20WAF,development%20url). If you have a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site, you might add a subdomain like `media.yoursite.com` through Cloudflare (or Bunny, etc.) to serve the large files. This is optional and mainly for convenience and performance tuning.
- ## Tools and Workflow for Uploading Assets
	- Managing large files outside of Git can be made easier with the right tools. Here are some recommended open-source (or free) utilities and approaches for bulk uploading and managing these assets:
	- **Rclone:** Rclone is a powerful open-source command-line program that supports a wide array of cloud storage services (including S3, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, and even FTP/SFTP for Bunny). Rclone can sync or copy entire folders to your storage bucket with one command. For example, Cloudflare's docs provide an example of using `rclone copy` to upload files to an R2 bucket (supports files up to 5 TB) [Upload and retrieve objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/examples/rclone/#:~:text=Upload%20and%20retrieve%20objects). You can configure rclone with your storage credentials and then easily script uploads. Rclone is particularly useful if you want to integrate media upload into your workflow or an automated GitHub Action (e.g., one could imagine an action that on release builds, uploads any new large media files via rclone to the storage). It supports features like checksums, synchronization, and can even encrypt files if needed.
	- **Official CLI tools (AWS CLI / B2 CLI / etc.):** If you prefer using provider-specific tools, you have options like the AWS CLI (which can interact with any S3-compatible storage including R2, Wasabi, IDrive e2, etc.), or Backblaze's B2 CLI for B2 storage. For instance, using the AWS CLI with R2 just requires setting the endpoint to R2's; you can then do `aws s3 cp localfile s3://your-r2-bucket/ --endpoint-url https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`. The AWS CLI and B2 CLI are both free and scriptable. These are suitable if you're comfortable with command-line operations and maybe integrating them in a deployment script.
	- **Bulk upload via web or UI:** Some services provide web dashboards to upload files (Cloudflare R2 allows direct file upload in their dashboard, Backblaze B2 has a web interface, etc.), but these are not ideal for large files or many files at once. A GUI like *Cyberduck* or *Mountain Duck* (desktop applications) can connect to various storage services and let you drag-and-drop files. Cyberduck is open source and supports S3, Backblaze B2, etc., which might be handy if you want a more visual approach. It can even generate shareable links.
	- **Logseq integration:** Currently, Logseq doesn't have native integration to auto-upload assets to an external store, but you can manage it manually. One approach is to keep your large files in a local folder (perhaps within your Logseq workspace or elsewhere) and exclude them from the Git repo. When you update that folder, use a script or rclone to sync it to your object storage. Then update your Logseq markdown links if new files were added. This could be semi-automated with a simple shell or Python script that uploads any new files and prints the URLs to use.
	- **GitHub Actions for upload:** If you want to automate uploading as part of your site publish workflow, you could configure a GitHub Action to run on push that uses one of the above tools (rclone, AWS CLI, B2 CLI) with your storage credentials (store them as GitHub Secrets) to upload assets. For example, a GitHub Action might detect any new file in an `assets-large/` directory and push it to your storage, then perhaps even update the Logseq content references (this part would be more complex and usually manual). If you prefer a simpler approach, handle uploads outside of GitHub by running rclone from your machine whenever needed.
	- In summary, **rclone** is highly recommended for its flexibility and support of many backends; it can handle whole-folder uploads and even has options to flatten directories or preserve structure as needed. Using the provider's CLI or AWS CLI is also reliable for scripting bulk transfers. All these tools are open-source or freely available. The key is to choose one that fits your workflow – for a one-time setup, a manual upload via a GUI might suffice, but for ongoing updates, a scripted approach will save time.
- ## Choosing an Approach (Recommendations)
	- For an individual, low-traffic Logseq site, the simplest and most cost-effective solution is to offload large media to an object storage with free or cheap egress. **Cloudflare R2** is a strong option given its no-egress model and seamless CDN integration on Cloudflare's network – you could likely host all your described files essentially for free (within the free-tier limits) and with minimal latency impact. If you already use Cloudflare for your domain, R2 fits in neatly. **Backblaze B2** with Cloudflare CDN is another excellent choice, especially if you anticipate storing more data long-term (B2's storage cost is lower). B2 is proven and reliable [I'm not sure about the reliability](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1ijzywl/does_cloudflare_cdn_add_extra_cost_over/#:~:text=I%27m%20not%20sure%20about%20the,offers%20free%20egress%20to%20CloudFlare), and its free egress to Cloudflare makes it nearly equivalent to R2 for this use case. **Git LFS** is the most integrated with your GitHub Pages workflow but comes with significant limitations (1 GB/month bandwidth cap, requiring an Actions hack to publish, and potential costs) [About storage and bandwidth usage](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage#:~:text=Every%20account%20using%20Git%20Large,additional%20quota%20for%20Git%20LFS) [Bandwidth quota](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage#:~:text=Bandwidth%20quota). It's generally not recommended for serving media to end-users unless the files are very infrequently accessed or very small. Finally, commercial CDNs like **Bunny.net** can offer great performance (global replication and no fear of violating TOS for videos) at a low price point – if you don't mind spending a few dollars, Bunny could simplify things by handling both storage and delivery. For truly zero-cost setups, sticking to R2 or B2+Cloudflare is ideal.
	- Whichever route you choose, ensure to update your Logseq publishing configuration to reference the correct URLs for the media.
