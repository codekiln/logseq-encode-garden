		- ## slide summaries
			- ### Slide: Title
				- "Bridging the AI Learning Gap"
				- "Teaching Developers to Think with AI"
				- Andrew Stellman, author of *Head First C#* and other O’Reilly books
			- ### Slide: When developers only ask AI for answers
				- They often get stuck
				- AI isn’t as effective when used passively
			- ### Slide: AI works best when developers think critically and guide it
				- Active engagement improves outcomes
				- Developers must be intentional and thoughtful
			- ### Slide: Asking the AI for answers vs. working with the AI to solve problems
				- Emphasizes a shift from passive to collaborative use
				- Illustrates a mindset transition developers need to make
			- ### Slide: We need to help developers cross the problem-solving gap
				- Visual: contrast between "Asking AI for answers" and "Working with AI to solve problems"
				- Core components needed:
					- Context
					- Research
					- Problem framing
			- ### Slide: Bridging the gap starts with how developers work with AI
				- Reinforces earlier point with added habits:
					- Refining
					- Critical thinking
			- ### Slide: When developers learn to guide AI, it becomes a partner
				- AI becomes a collaborative tool rather than a crutch
				- Reflects learning and mastery
			- ### Slide: Sens-AI bridges the gap
				- Teaches essential AI habits
				- Strengthens coding skills
				- Designed to foster intentional, skill-building AI use

			- ### AI Summary
				- Andrew Stellman argues that developers who rely on AI solely for answers often become stuck, as this limits their problem-solving growth.
				- He emphasizes the importance of *working with* AI through active guidance, critical thinking, and problem framing.
				- The talk introduces Sens-AI, a learning platform aimed at early-career developers that integrates coding practice with AI literacy, helping them develop essential habits for collaborating with AI.
				- Stellman’s core message is that bridging the AI learning gap requires not just using AI tools, but *thinking with them*—developing context, refining ideas, and cultivating problem-solving mindsets.
