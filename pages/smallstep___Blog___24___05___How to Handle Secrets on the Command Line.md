		- TL;DR: Best practices for #CLI secrets: (1) Use credential files with proper permissions and disk encryption; (2) Use pipes to pass secrets directly between programs; (3) Avoid [[EnvVars]] environment variables when possible; (4) **Never pass secrets directly in command arguments**; (5) Consider using a keyring facility like [[Linux/keyring]] for in-memory storage; (6) For specific tools, use their built-in credential storage (like [[dotfile/.netrc]] for [[curl]]).
	- The command line really wasn't designed for secrets. So, keeping secrets secret on the command line requires some extra care and effort.
	- All of these values, including the precious contents of the private key file, can be seen via `ps` when these commands are running. [[ps]] finds them via `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, which is globally readable for any process ID.
	- ### Credentials Files
		- What's not to love about a file? It's got an owner. It has permissions and access control.
		- Give each secret a file! Any program that accepts secrets should be able to accept them by passing a filename or by redirecting a file into `STDIN`. You can also use files to pass secrets into Docker containers with mounted volumes.
		- Be sure your disk is encrypted at rest, eg. with LUKS
		- Using environment variables for secrets is very convenient. And we don't recommend it because it's so easy to leak things
		- Some operating systems still make every process's environment variables world readable.
		- In Docker, anyone with access to the [[Docker]] daemon can use `docker inspect` to see all of the environment variables for any running container.
		- Variables can easily end up in shell history. In many shells, adding an extra space before a command will exclude it from shell history.
	- ### What About A Secrets Manager?
		- Speaking of lightweight solutions, there is an keyring facility in the Linux kernel
		- The [[Linux/keyring]] offers several scopes for storing keys safely in memory that will never be swapped to disk. A process or even a single thread can have its own keyring, or you can have a keyring that is inherited across all processes in a user's session. To manage the keyrings and keys, use the [`keyctl`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/keyctl.1.html) command or [`keyctl`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/keyctl.2.html) system calls.
	- ### Directly in the command
		- In case it isn't already abundantly clear, this is very unsafe. There is no way for the caller of a command to choose to hide the command line from being world readable.
		- any CLI command worth its salt should not accept passwords directly.
		- The alternative for [[curl]] is a credential file: A [`.netrc` file](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/netrc) can be used to store credentials for servers you need to connect to.
