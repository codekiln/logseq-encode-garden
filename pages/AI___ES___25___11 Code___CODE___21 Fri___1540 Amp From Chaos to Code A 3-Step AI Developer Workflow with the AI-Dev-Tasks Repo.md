	- ## Talk: [Amp] From Chaos to Code — A 3-Step AI Developer Workflow with the AI-Dev-Tasks Repo
		- In today's world of rapidly evolving AI tools, writing a single "big prompt" rarely leads to a reliable, maintainable feature. In this talk, you'll discover a proven three-step workflow that brings structure and predictability to AI-driven development. We'll explore the open-source repository AI‑Dev‑Tasks (GitHub: snarktank/ai-dev-tasks) - a minimal system of markdown files that bridges ideation, planning, and execution so that AI becomes a consistent teammate rather than a chaotic wildcard.
		- You'll learn:
			- How to author a lightweight Product Requirement Document (PRD) that aligns human and AI expectations.
			- How to break that PRD into an actionable task list that the AI can reliably execute - one task at a time – while you maintain visibility and control.
			- How to review, approve and iterate on tasks - so that the AI's output becomes trustworthy code, not surprise output.
		- By the end of the session, you'll walk away with a reproducible workflow you can adopt right away, enabling you to go from idea to working feature with fewer surprises, less manual rework, and more confidence in AI-assisted development. This talk is ideal for engineers, product folks and AI-tool adopters who want to move beyond "throwing prompts at the models" and build something dependable.
