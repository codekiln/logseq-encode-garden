alias:: [[Runtime]]

- # Runtime
	- Also known as: run-time, runtime execution, execution time
	- The phase when a program is actually executing, after compilation
	- Operations and evaluations that occur while the program is running
	- ## Definition
		- The period during which a compiled program executes
		- The execution environment where program code runs
		- Dynamic behavior that cannot be determined until the program runs
	- ## Key Characteristics
		- **Dynamic Execution**: Code is executed with actual data and user input
		- **Runtime Environment**: The system that executes the program (virtual machine, interpreter, or native execution)
		- **Dynamic Behavior**: Values and control flow determined by runtime conditions
		- **Error Handling**: Runtime errors occur during execution
	- ## Runtime Operations
		- ### Program Execution
			- Instruction execution
			- Memory allocation and deallocation
			- Function calls and stack management
		- ### Dynamic Behavior
			- User input processing
			- Network requests
			- File I/O operations
			- Database queries
		- ### Runtime Checks
			- Array bounds checking (in some languages)
			- Null pointer checks
			- Type checks (in dynamically typed languages)
			- Resource availability checks
		- ### Memory Management
			- Heap allocation
			- Garbage collection (in managed languages)
			- Stack management
	- ## Runtime vs Compile-Time
		- **Runtime**: Dynamic behavior, user interaction, actual execution
		- **Compile-Time**: Static analysis, type checking, constant evaluation
		- Some languages (like Python, JavaScript) have minimal compile-time checks
	- ## Runtime Environments
		- ### Virtual Machines
			- JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
			- .NET CLR (Common Language Runtime)
			- Erlang BEAM
		- ### Interpreters
			- Python interpreter
			- JavaScript engines (V8, SpiderMonkey)
		- ### Native Execution
			- Compiled languages that run directly on hardware
			- Rust, C, C++, Go (when compiled to native code)
	- ## Runtime Errors
		- Errors that occur during program execution
		- Examples:
			- Null pointer exceptions
			- Array index out of bounds
			- Division by zero
			- File not found
			- Network timeouts
		- Contrast with compile-time errors, which prevent the program from being built
	- ## Language Examples
		- ### Dynamically Typed Languages
			- Python, JavaScript, Ruby: Most type checking happens at runtime
			- Type errors only discovered when code executes
		- ### Statically Typed Languages
			- Rust, Java, C#: Most type checking at compile-time
			- Runtime errors typically from logic errors or resource issues
	- ## Benefits and Trade-offs
		- **Flexibility**: Can handle dynamic data and user input
		- **Runtime Optimization**: Just-in-time (JIT) compilation can optimize hot paths
		- **Error Discovery**: Some errors only appear at runtime
		- **Performance Overhead**: Runtime checks add execution overhead
