## UTM
	- UTM is an open-source [[Virtual Machine]] application for [[Apple]] platforms, used to create and manage full system VMs on [[MacOS]], [[iOS]], and visionOS.
	- ### Architecture and core design
		- **[[QEMU]]** → CPU + device emulation
		- **[[Apple/Hypervisor.framework]]** → hardware-assisted virtualization on Apple Silicon & Intel Macs
		- UTM → native macOS GUI around QEMU configs
		- Two execution modes:
			- [[Virtualization]] (hardware accelerated)
				- Near-native speed
				- Requires same CPU architecture as host
				- Best for: Linux ARM on Apple Silicon, Windows ARM on Apple Silicon
			- [[Emulation]]
				- Cross-architecture (e.g., x86 on Apple Silicon)
				- Slower (full CPU translation)
				- Useful for legacy systems or testing
		- UTM is essentially a GUI virtual machine manager built on top of [[QEMU]]. On macOS it integrates with Apple’s Hypervisor framework for near-native virtualization of  [[ARM64]] and  [[CPU/Arch/x86]] guests when the host CPU is compatible, falling back to QEMU’s [[JIT]] or interpreter for cross-architecture emulation (for example, x86 on Apple silicon).
		- This design lets users pick between speed (virtualization) and flexibility (emulation), while UTM’s UI generates and manages the underlying QEMU configurations, so users typically don’t have to hand-craft QEMU command lines.
