- # [Unicode Block Reference: Symbols for Legacy Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbols_for_Legacy_Computing)
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- I created a [[Semigraphics/Sextant Characters/Py Grid Utility]] for [[Proj/CGoL Bio]]
		- Some of these are also in [[Font/unscii]]
	- ## Overview
		- The Symbols for Legacy Computing block (U+1FB00â€“U+1FBFF) contains 249 assigned code points out of 256 total
		- Added to Unicode in version 13.0 (2020) with 212 characters, expanded in Unicode 16.0 (2024) with 37 additional characters
		- Contains graphical characters for compatibility with legacy computing platforms from the 1970s and 1980s
		- Located in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP)
	- ## Structure
		- Characters are organized by visual similarity and original platform
		- Hexadecimal code points are used for precise identification
		- The block includes 7 reserved code points that are currently unused
	- ## Core Components
		- ### Block Elements and Sextants (U+1FB00â€“U+1FB3B)
			- 60 characters for block drawing and pixel art
			- Includes "sextant" characters (semigraphic characters made up of six smaller blocks)
			- Compatible with CP437 and similar encodings
			- Example: U+1FB00 'ðŸ¬€' BLOCK SEXTANT-1
		- ### Teletext Elements (U+1FB3Câ€“U+1FB6F)
			- Characters used in Teletext broadcasting standards
			- Compatible with NAPLPS and similar standards
			- Example: U+1FB3C 'ðŸ¬¼' BLOCK SEXTANT-121
		- ### Legacy Computer Characters (U+1FB70â€“U+1FBFF)
			- Characters from various home computers including:
				- Amstrad CPC
				- MSX
				- Mattel Aquarius
				- RISC OS
				- MouseText
				- Atari ST
				- TRS-80 Color Computer
				- Oric
				- Texas Instruments TI-99/4A
				- Minitel
				- ATASCII
				- PETSCII
				- ZX80 and ZX81
	- ## Technical Details
		- Script property: Common
		- All characters have East Asian Width property: Neutral (N)
		- General Category: Symbol, Other (So)
		- Bidirectional Class: Other Neutral (ON)
		- A supplemental block (Symbols for Legacy Computing Supplement) was added with Unicode 16.0
