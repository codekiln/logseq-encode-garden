- ## Conceptual Overview of Open Sound Control (OSC)
	- Open Sound Control (OSC) is a modern protocol for networking sound synthesizers, computers, and other multimedia devices. Developed in the late 1990s at [[CNMAT]] (Center for New Music and Audio Technologies) by Adrian Freed and others, OSC offers a flexible, high-resolution alternative to MIDI.
	- ### Design Principles
		- **Human-readable address patterns**: OSC messages use URI-style address strings (e.g., `/synth/frequency`) to reference parameters or actions.
		- **Arbitrary data types**: Unlike MIDI's limited integer-based data, OSC supports 32-bit floats, strings, blobs, and more.
		- **Timetagging**: Messages can include timestamps for scheduling future events.
		- **Transport-independent**: While most OSC implementations use UDP for low-latency communication, it can also be transported via TCP, serial, or WebSockets.
	- ### Message Structure
		- **Address Pattern**: Specifies the destination (e.g., `/voice/1/volume`)
		- **Type Tag String**: A comma-prefixed list indicating the type of each argument (e.g., `,f` for a float)
		- **Arguments**: The payload of the messageâ€”data values like numbers or strings
	- ### Example
		- A message to set the pitch of a voice might look like:
			- Address: `/voice/1/freq`
			- Type Tags: `,f`
			- Arguments: `440.0`
	- ### Applications
		- **Live performance**: Control of software instruments, lighting, and visual projections
		- **Telematic art**: Synchronizing performance elements over the internet
		- **Interactive installations**: Connecting sensors and actuators to real-time audio systems
		- **Experimental research**: Used in academic projects exploring alternate input modalities and responsive environments
	- ### Comparison with MIDI
		- OSC allows richer, more expressive data and isn't confined to a fixed protocol
		- Lacks built-in widespread hardware support that MIDI enjoys
		- Suited for custom software ecosystems, often requiring developer integration
	- ### Role of [[Person/Matthew Goodheart]]
		- As a composer, performer, and researcher, Matthew Goodheart has explored OSC as part of his work on resonance-based instrument design and responsive performance systems.
		- His integration of OSC enables nuanced communication between gestural interfaces, resonating objects, and reactive sound synthesis environments.
	- ### Tools and Environments
		- **SuperCollider**: Native support for OSC; ideal for dynamic synthesis
		- **Max/MSP**: Widely used in installation and performance art; includes `udpsend`/`udpreceive` for OSC
		- **Pure Data (Pd)**: Open-source cousin of Max; good for academic and DIY use
		- **TouchDesigner, Processing, Unity**: Used for audio-visual installations with OSC bridges
	- ### Conclusion
		- OSC is not just a protocol but a philosophy of **open, extensible communication** between disparate systems in real-time media art and research.
		- Its flexibility makes it an enduring tool for artists and technologists committed to expressive interactivity.
