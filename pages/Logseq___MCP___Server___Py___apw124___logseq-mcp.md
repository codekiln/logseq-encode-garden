- # apw124's Logseq MCP Server
	- GitHub: [apw124/logseq-mcp](https://github.com/apw124/logseq-mcp)
	- ## Overview
		- An earlier Python MCP server (MIT-licensed) with similar goals to dailydaniel's project. It exposes a rich set of namespace functions for Logseq operations.
	- ## Features
		- Rich set of namespace functions under `logseq.`:
			- `logseq.get_page`
			- `logseq.create_block`
			- `logseq.update_block`
		- Fine-grained block operations:
			- Moving blocks
			- Searching blocks by text content
		- Aims for full parity with Logseq's plugin API
	- ## Status
		- **Mostly inactive** (single-digit GitHub stars)
		- May have been a proof-of-concept
		- Precursor to the more polished dailydaniel project
	- ## Installation
		- Via source: `pip install -e .`
	- ## Usage
		- Tied to the Cursor IDE/Claude integration
