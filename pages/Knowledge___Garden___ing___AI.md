		- Using AI tools to help with Knowledge Gardening tasks is going to become an important part of how my personal AI agents are able to draw on my experience and bring into [[AI/Context]]. I've started cultivating a toolset to help AI maintain my knowledge garden. In time, I hope to add a [[AI Deep Research]] tool to [[CICD]] to do slow iterations of research on topics. Hopefully it will only become the good version of [[Norbot]].
