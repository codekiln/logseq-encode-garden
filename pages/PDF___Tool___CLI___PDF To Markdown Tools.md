# #PDF to #Markdown [[CLI Tools]]
	- ## [[ChatGPT/Deep Research/Query]] - [PDF to Markdown Conversion](https://chatgpt.com/c/67d145bf-8c40-800a-b1e5-07671a210396)
		- ### **Query: The State of the Art in Local Command-Line PDF to Markdown Conversion**
		  id:: 67d14d5f-738e-4189-9323-64e17723b94e
			- #### **Primary Objective:**
				- Identify **the best open-source and battle-tested command-line tools** for converting PDFs to **CommonMark-compliant Markdown** while preserving structure, formatting, and readability. The tools must not require **external APIs**Â (but LLM APIs are okay) and should be installable via package managers , straightforward compilation, or in a Docker image.
			- #### **Core Requirements:**
				- **Markdown Output**:
					- CommonMark-compliant Markdown (GitHub Flavored Markdown preferred).
					- Fenced code blocks (`````) should include language annotation.
					- Bold (`**bold**`) and italic (`*italic*`) text should be preserved.
					- Strikethrough (`~~text~~`), blockquotes (`> text`), and lists (`- item` / `1. item`) should be correctly formatted.
					- Line breaks should be normalized for readability (not preserved from the PDF).
				- **Images & Non-Text Elements**:
					- Extract and save images separately with relative markdown references (`![alt text](image.png)`).
					- **Bonus**: Any support for auto-generating alt text for images.
					- Convert simple tables to Markdown tables; for complex tables, extract them into `.csv` files and reference them in Markdown.
				- **Structural & Semantic Preservation**:
					- Detect and apply proper heading levels (`# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`) for accessibility and screen reader compatibility.
					- Maintain logical reading order in multi-column PDFs (especially for academic papers).
					- Support footnotes in Markdown format, positioned at the **end of the document** (not per page).
				- **Metadata Handling**:
					- Extract PDF metadata (title, author, creation date) into **YAML frontmatter** (preferred) or another structured format.
				- **Performance & Execution**:
					- Optimized for **accuracy over speed** (handling large PDFs is expected).
					- No external API calls; must work entirely offline.
					- Installable via `pip`, `brew`, `cargo`, or `apt`; compiling from source is acceptable but not ideal.
					- Single-file processing is sufficient, but batch-processing support is a plus.
			- #### **Secondary Considerations:**
				- **OCR Support (For Future Research, Not Required in Primary Tool)**:
					- If OCR tools exist for extracting text from scanned PDFs into Markdown, document best practices.
					- How OCR-based Markdown extraction tools handle citations, errors, and structured references.
				- **Tooling Maturity & Community Support**:
					- Only consider **actively maintained** open-source tools with strong GitHub activity and issue tracking.
					- If a proprietary tool exists that **meets all criteria and is free**, document it as well.
					- No experimental, proof-of-concept, or abandoned projects.
			- #### **Nice-to-Have Features (Non-Essential but Valuable):**
				- Structured CLI output (e.g., JSON) for programmatic processing.
				- The ability to split large documents into multiple Markdown files with **relative links**.
				- Handling of internal document references (e.g., footnotes, citations).
				- Support for extracting vector-based diagrams into **SVG** format.
		- ### **Execution:**
			- **Identify 1-3 best tools** that match the above requirements.
			- **Contextual reliability**: Prefer references from respected engineering teams, active GitHub projects, or technical blogs over casual forum discussions (e.g., prioritize engineering blogs, well-documented repositories).
			- **Comparison analysis**: If multiple tools exist, compare their strengths, weaknesses, and any trade-offs.
