		- ## Conceptual overview
			- The **Joy-Con** is [[Co/Nintendo]]’s modular, dual-piece controller family for the [[Co/Nintendo/Console/Switch]] Switch consoles.  Detachable design lets each half operate as a standalone pad, combine into a grip, or slide onto the console for handheld play, making it the physical hinge of the Switch’s hybrid identity. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
			- ### Core interaction model
				- **Inputs** – Each Joy-Con packs an analog stick, ABXY/​+- or D-Pad equivalent buttons, SL/SR toppers, shoulder triggers, capture / home keys, and NFC for Amiibo.
				- **Sensors** – 6-axis IMU (gyro + accelerometer) in *both* halves and an IR-motion camera (right-hand unit) enable motion, pointing, and depth-sensing gameplay. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
				- **Haptics & audio** – HD Rumble actuators produce fine-grained vibration queues; the Switch 2 revision bumps this to “HD Rumble 2” for stronger, faster feedback. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
				- **Connectivity & power** – Bluetooth LE + Nintendo’s proprietary rail (or new magnetic latch) handle pairing, charging, and data; internal Li-ion cells last ≈20 h and recharge in ~3.5 h when docked or in the Charging Grip. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
			- ### Design principles
				- **Symmetry & accessibility** – Both halves mirror enough controls to act as mini-pads for spontaneous local multiplayer or adaptable layouts (e.g., single-hand play).
				- **Context-adaptive form** – Rail / magnetic coupling means the same controller supports handheld mobility, tabletop detachment, docked couch play, and motion-gaming stances.
				- **Sensor fusion for playful affordances** – Combining IMU, IR, and precise haptics lets software evoke ice cubes in a glass, pulse checks in Ring Fit, or cardboard mechs in Labo, showcasing Nintendo’s “toylike” design ethos.
			- ### Evolution to **Joy-Con 2** (Switch 2, 2025)
				- **Magnetic attachment** replaces rails for quicker snap-on/off and reduced wear.
				- **Larger shell & controls** improve ergonomics; metal SL/SR buttons aid durability; an extra **“C” button** triggers built-in GameChat.
				- **Mouse-mode & dual IR sensors** let each Joy-Con work as an optical puck on a flat surface, expanding pointer-style mechanics. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
				- **Sticks still potentiometer-based** – Nintendo claims “larger, smoother, more durable” parts, but early teardowns show similar hardware, so drift may persist. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
			- ### Limitations & considerations
				- **Stick-drift legacy** – Potentiometer wear can cause false input; Nintendo offers repairs, and third-party Hall-effect replacements exist, but official sticks remain vulnerable. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
				- **Feature fragmentation** – Original Joy-Cons lack Joy-Con 2 magnetic mount and mouse/“C” features; Joy-Con 2 omits the legacy right-only IR camera required by some Switch 1 titles, so cross-generation compatibility varies. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
				- **Battery stewardship** – Non-user-replaceable cells demand whole-unit servicing; heavy HD Rumble use shortens per-session life.
			- ### Takeaway
				- The Joy-Con line embodies Nintendo’s philosophy: **versatility over raw specs**, blending modular form, motion sensing, and expressive haptics to invite novel play styles—while ongoing stick-durability issues remind users that innovation often travels with trade-offs.
