	- [[My Notes]]
		- has an example of two different `devcontainer.json` - one at `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and one at `.devcontainer/codespaces/.devcontainer.json` for [[GitHub/Codespaces]]
			- the [[Codespace]] one makes use of environment variables like `CODESPACE_NAME`,  `${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}`, and points to the same compose file as `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
				- I like how the codespace one has this bit, which has bit me a few times. Uses [[DevContainer/Ref/Key/onCreateCommand]] and [[DevContainer/Ref/Variable/containerWorkspaceFolder]]
					- `  "onCreateCommand": "git config --global --add safe.directory ${containerWorkspaceFolder}",`
