	- > software architect; volunteer programmer in open source. Remote positions only; tell me about your company's product and tech stack. No Meta, Twitter, Tesla, blockchain/crypto-currencies, AI. Not a certified P.Eng.

		- I write code, much of it in Perl, for a variety of real-world applications, most recently for building and maintaining network infrastructure. I work on the full stack, from front end UIs down to hardware interfaces, in technologies such as Mojolicious, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Ansible and Docker to keep critical systems running and make them faster, more reliable and provide features that fulfill business objectives and thrill users.
		- In my spare time I volunteer in a variety of ways to make the Perl language and infrastructure better, participating in working groups and committees and authoring and maintaining open source software on [CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html) and Github.
	- I have worked remotely for ten years quite successfully, and at this point in time am not considering in-office employment.
	- It is okay to tell me about new job opportunities. It is NOT okay to try to sell me your company's products or services. I do not make purchasing decisions.
	- Job pitches are much more likely to elicit a response if you tell me up front about the tech stack you are using and the product space you're in.
