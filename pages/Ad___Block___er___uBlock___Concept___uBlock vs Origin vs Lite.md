- # uBlock vs uBlock Origin vs uBlock Origin Lite
	- [[Ad/Block/er/uBlock/Origin/Lite]] uBlock Origin Lite (uBOL) was developed to comply with Chrome's Manifest V3 (MV3) extension framework, which imposes stricter limitations on ad-blocking extensions. As a result, uBOL offers a more streamlined experience compared to the original uBlock Origin. Here are some key features that were available in uBlock Origin but are no longer present in uBlock Origin Lite:
	- ### 🔧 Features Removed in uBlock Origin Lite
		- **Custom Filters and Dynamic Filtering**: uBOL does not support custom user-defined filters or dynamic filtering of scripts and iframes. This means users cannot create or modify filter lists beyond what is provided by default. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
		- **Per-Site Settings**: The ability to configure per-site blocking rules or exceptions is absent in uBOL. Users cannot tailor the extension's behavior for specific websites. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
		- **Element Picker and Cosmetic Filtering**: uBOL lacks tools for hiding specific elements on a webpage or applying cosmetic filters to adjust the appearance of a site. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
		- **Advanced Logging and Debugging Tools**: The advanced logger and debugging tools available in uBlock Origin are not present in uBOL, limiting users' ability to diagnose and troubleshoot filtering issues. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
		- **Advanced Privacy Features**: uBOL offers limited privacy protections compared to uBlock Origin. For instance, it does not support advanced features like CNAME uncloaking, which helps in identifying and blocking trackers that use deceptive domain names. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
		- **Filter List Updates**: In uBOL, filter lists are updated only when the extension itself is updated, rather than receiving real-time updates as in uBlock Origin. This can result in slower response to emerging threats. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
		- **Ad Block Counter**: The visual ad block counter feature, which displays the number of blocked requests, is not available in uBOL. [All About Cookies](https://allaboutcookies.org/ublock-origin-lite-vs-ublock-origin?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
		- **UI Customization**: uBOL offers a more simplified user interface with fewer customization options compared to uBlock Origin. [All About Cookies](https://allaboutcookies.org/ublock-origin-lite-vs-ublock-origin?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- These limitations stem from the constraints imposed by Manifest V3, which restricts the capabilities of extensions to enhance browser performance and security. While uBlock Origin Lite provides basic ad-blocking functionality, users seeking advanced features may need to consider alternative solutions or browsers that support Manifest V2 extensions.
