		- 18:19 begins with little hazy, fog obscured neon traces behind a windowpane
			- the visuals are engaging but not too much. formless but evocative of space, water, melting, ... absolute music for visuals.
		- skittering, first up front, then sides. some organ, rain static in the background.
		- TODO 18:24 attach #Video
		- 18:24 now we have some more geometric shapes in 3d  - contributes to the growing drama. pulsing, changing back into white shape cuts.
		- Pretty #Cool - apparently he was playing live with the [[Joy-Con Controller]] live (I couldn't see him)
	- ## #Description
		- #Short
			- A live audiovisual piece that uses a Nintendo Joy-Con controller to manipulate sound and visuals in real-time, creating an immersive experience that explores the relationship between physical gesture and digital response.
		- #Long
			- **Shadows’ Resonance** is a live audio-visual composition for the [[Game/Video/Controller/Joy-Con]].
			- intertwines ancient sounds of traditional Chinese instruments, the [[Instrument/Guqin]] and [[Instrument/Xiao]], with ML-based interactive technology.
			- The performer uses the Joy-Con controller to dynamically manipulate both the sound and the visual elements, creating an immersive experience. Incorporating machine learning, the system learns and recognises the performer’s gestures to seamlessly switch between the two instruments and various performer techniques. This adds a layer of interaction and responsiveness, allowing for an enhancement of fluid and expressive performance. The visual component of Shadows’ Resonance begins with real-time fluid simulations, visually representing the music’s flow. As the composition progresses, these visuals and sounds evolve into abstract shapes and forms, symbolising a journey from illusion to enlightenment. Through the interplay of traditional sounds and cutting-edge visuals, Shadows’ Resonance explores themes of perception, reality, and transformation, creating a multi-sensory experience that is both reflective and transformative.
