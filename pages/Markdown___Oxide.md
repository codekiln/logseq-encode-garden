		- Markdown-Oxide is a [PKMS](https://oxide.md/PKMS) that composes with your favorite text-editor through the [LSP](https://oxide.md/LSP).
		- While other [PKMS](https://oxide.md/PKMS) implementations include their own text-editors, markdown-oxide is unbundled: it leaves text-editing to a dedicated text-editor and focuses solely on robust, performant knowledge management.
		- inspired by and highly compatible with Obsidian.
		- The best-supported text editor is Neovim, but also popular with users are VSCode, Helix, and Zed.
