- # Technique: Using AWS IAM Identity Center for Long-Lived Temporary Credentials
	- Related: [[AWS/IAM/Identity Center]] [[AWS/IAM/Role Chaining]] [[AWS/Okta Keyman]]
	- ## Problem: Role Chaining Limitations
		- Long-lived temporary credentials are a concern when using role chaining
		- When assuming a role (e.g., via [[AWS/Okta Keyman]]) into a landing area and then assuming another role, that's considered role chaining
		- AWS restricts chained sessions to a maximum of **one hour**
	- ## Solution: AWS IAM Identity Center
		- AWS IAM Identity Center provides a centralized landing page where users can:
			- Access AWS accounts through the console, or
			- Retrieve **temporary CLI credentials** on a per-account basis
		- The lifespan of those temporary credentials can be configured anywhere from **1 hour up to 12 hours**
	- ## Integration Approach
		- Identity Center integrates with identity providers like [[Okta]]
		- Create groups in the identity provider (e.g., Okta)
		- Add users to those groups
		- Sync them to AWS Identity Center within a centralized AWS account via **SCIM provisioning**
		- Permissions are managed at the group level using **Terraform**
	- ## AWS Recommendation
		- AWS recommends using Identity Center for Bedrock API keys: [Accelerate AI development with Amazon Bedrock API keys](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerate-ai-development-with-amazon-bedrock-api-keys/)
