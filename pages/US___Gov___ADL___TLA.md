- # Total Learning Architecture (TLA)
	- A research and development project by [[US/Gov/ADL]] to create an integrated learning services environment
	- [Official Project Page](https://www.adlnet.gov/projects/tla/)
	- ## üéØ Core Purpose
		- Enable personalized, data-driven, technology-enabled lifelong learning across:
			- Department of Defense
			- Other Federal Government agencies
			- Beyond government sectors
		- Create a "continuum of learning" that is:
			- Continuous (career-long vs episodic)
			- Blended (formal + informal)
			- Enterprise-focused
			- Learner-centric
			- Data-driven
			- Competency-based
			- On-demand
			- Cloud-based
	- ## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components
		- ### Data Standards
			- Built on key [[IEEE]] specifications:
				- [[IEEE/Std/P9274.1 Experience API xAPI 2.0]] for activity tracking
					- Includes [[xAPI]] Profiles like [[cmi5]]
					- Features TLA's Master Object Model (MOM)
				- [[IEEE/Std/1484.12.1-2020 Learner Object Metadata 2.0]] for content description
				- [[IEEE/Std/1484.20.3 Sharable Competency Definitions]] for competency frameworks
				- [[IEEE/Std/2997 Enterprise Learning Record]] for learner profiles
		- ### Key Projects
			- #### Competency and Skills System (CaSS)
				- Manages competency frameworks
				- Creates sharable learner profiles
				- Integrates with existing [[LMS]]s
			- #### Data Analytics and Visualizations (DAVE)
				- Extends [[xAPI]] capabilities
				- Provides analysis and visualization tools
			- #### DATASIM
				- Open-source testing tool
				- Generates datasets for TLA validation
				- Helps evaluate [[xAPI]] implementations
			- #### Privacy Support (PS4TLA)
				- Implements user-tailored privacy
				- Creates personalized privacy models
			- #### FLUENT
				- Adaptive recommendation system
				- Analyzes [[xAPI]] data for learning patterns
				- Identifies effective learning sequences
	- ## ü§ù Implementation Partners
		- ### Military
			- Air Force Learning Services Environment (AFLSE)
			- Army Futures Command
			- Defense Health Agency (DHA)
		- ### Intelligence Community
			- Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence
			- Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency
	- ## üìö Related Standards
		- Builds upon and integrates with:
			- [[SCORM]] (historical foundation)
			- [[xAPI]] (core data standard)
			- [[cmi5]] (launching and tracking)
			- [[IMS/Common Cartridge]] (content packaging)
	- ## üîÑ Development Process
		- Started in 2016
		- Uses spiral design-based research
		- Focus on:
			- Technical specifications
			- Standards development
			- Policy guidance
			- Reference implementations
		- Emphasis on "plug and play" interoperability
	- ## üéØ Future Direction
		- Moving toward:
			- AI and machine learning integration
			- Enhanced data analytics
			- Improved competency tracking
			- Greater system interoperability
		- Goal: Create a unified learning ecosystem that supports:
			- Multiple learning modalities
			- Various delivery points
			- Comprehensive data collection
			- Advanced analytics
			- Personalized learning paths
