	- [[IEEE]] standards
		- [[IEEE/Std/P9274.1 Experience API xAPI 2.0]] ([[xAPI]]) – Learning activity tracking uses the xAPI to capture learning activity streams. The xAPI standard also includes xAPI Profiles such as cmi5 and the TLA’s Master Object Model (MOM). xAPI 2.0 is targeted for approval in 2020.
		- [[IEEE/Std/1484.12.1 Learner Object Metadata 2.0]] – Descriptions of learning activities and their associated content are stored in the TLA’s Experience Index and use a modified version of the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative standard. A draft standard is being submitted for finalization in early 2020.
		- [[IEEE/Std/1484.20.3 Sharable Competency Definitions]] – The definition of a competency, the relationship to other competencies, and the alignment of evidence to help measure proficiency of the competency, are included in this standard. This standard is expected for approval in 2022.
		- [[IEEE/Std/2997 Enterprise Learning Record]] – Learner profile standards do not currently meet all TLA requirements. These new standards are actively being developed and modified based on input from numerous industry groups and associations.
