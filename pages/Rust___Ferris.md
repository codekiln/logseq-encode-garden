	- ## Why a crab?
		- ### 🦀 [[Rustaceans]]
			- Rust community members often jokingly call themselves **Rustaceans** — a play on *crustacean*. If the people are Rustaceans, the mascot being a crustacean (crab) fits perfectly.
		- ### 🦀 Ferris = “Ferri-cious” pun
			- The name *Ferris* comes from *ferrous* (relating to iron), since *rust* is oxidized iron. So:
			- **Rust → iron → ferrous → Ferris.**
			- And Ferris just happened to be designed as an adorable crab.
		- ### 🦀 Crabs are “safe”
			- There’s also a cute metaphor floating around: crabs have a **hard shell** (safety) and **claws** (power) — mirroring Rust’s safety-and-control philosophy.
	- ## History
		- Ferris was created by [[Person/Karen Rustad Tolva]] (formerly Karen Rustad), an early member of the Rust community, around [[2015]]
	- ## **Design Philosophy**
		- Ferris was intentionally:
			- **Friendly**, not fierce
			- **Gender-neutral**
			- **CC-BY licensed** so the community could remix and use it freely
			- Drawn in a **simple, expressive vector style** that works at many sizes
		- Ferris quickly became a symbol of Rust’s welcoming culture, especially important given Rust’s mission to make systems programming feel approachable.
	- ## **Canonical Traits of Ferris**
		- Always smiling or expressive
		- Small legs, big claws
		- Orange body
		- No sharp angles or threatening posture
		- Often shown interacting with code concepts (ownership, borrow checker, concurrency)
	- ## **Ferris vs. Rust Logo**
		- The **official Rust logo** is the gear-shaped “R”.
		- **Ferris is not official**, but *widely used* by the community, conferences, crates, meetups, and merchandise.
	- ## **Extended Family**
		- The community later created variants:
			- **“Oxidation” Ferris** (angry)
			- **“Borrow Checker” Ferris** (glowing eyes)
			- **“Safety Dance” Ferris**
			- **“Rustacean” badge Ferris**
		- Many more, all based on open, remixable SVGs
