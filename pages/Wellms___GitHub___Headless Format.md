	- ## The Abstract
		- Current e-learning software comes with a huge technological debt and does not respond to market needs as fast as other IT segments can. The main reason is dependency on obsolete formats like SCORM that are still widely used, and which do not separate data layer from the presentation layer. There is a need from market for existence of better designed and better implemented formats.
	- ## [[ULAM]] [Format](https://escolalms.github.io/headless-format/#ulam-format.)
		- > Because of the shortcomings of existing standards of course content definitions, I thereby propose a new standard which I will call **`ulam`** or **Universal Learning Asynchronous Model**.
