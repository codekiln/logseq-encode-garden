- # The End of Machine Learning Engineering as We Know It â€“ [[Person/Lili Jiang]] (15 minutes)
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- ### high level
			- REALLY great talk
			- #### Action items
				- TODO find lili jiang's blogs, etc and subscribe to [[Person/Lili Jiang]]
		- worked for quora
			- key question - merging questions about cookie recipes
		- machine learning engineer is now becoming an eval engineer
		- also worked at [[Waymo]] - led the [[AI/Eval]] team
		- "in other words, the eval code is similar in complexity with the code under eval"
		- 15:06 eval metrics are increasingly looking like eval algorithms
		- 15:06 comparison to feature engineering in the modeling step
		- 15:07 how do we build a flywheel to identify these evaluation metrics?
			- time with [[Coverbase]] LLM [[Vendor/Management]]
