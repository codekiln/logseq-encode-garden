				- Generative AI and particularly LLMs (Large Language Models) have exploded into the public consciousness. Like many software developers I am intrigued by the possibilities, but unsure what exactly it will mean for our profession in the long run. I have now taken on a role in Thoughtworks to coordinate our work on how this technology will affect software delivery practices. I'm posting various memos here to describe what my colleagues and I are learning and thinking.
