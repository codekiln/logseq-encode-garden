# How to use [[ChatGPT]] to produce a 1-sample audio clip
	- [[Use Case]]
		- In Ableton, it can help to have an empty or silent audio file that can be dragged into an audio track just for color coding the track or having a way to name a clip. There's no easy way to produce this in Ableton as far as I know; the easiest method is to just ask ChatGPT to produce such a file.
	- [[Prompt]]
		- > I want to create a 1-sample silent WAV file (at 44.1kHz sample rate). Please generate Python code using any appropriate libraries (like scipy, wave, numpy, or pydub) to produce a stereo 16-bit 44.1kHz WAV file that contains exactly one silent sample (0 amplitude). The file should be playable in Ableton Live and usable as a placeholder clip. Then, save it as silent.wav. Make sure the duration is 1 sample (not 1 ms), that it's stereo. Please do this now using your code interpreter and provide it as a file download.
	- ## How to use
		- After obtaining the downloaded file (sample here: ![silent.wav](mdc:../assets/Audio/silent.wav)), drag it to a track and assign it a color.
