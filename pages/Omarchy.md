			- > The majority of these environments are managed by [[mise]] [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/). It's a tool that lets you install and run multiple versions of a programming language on the same machine. It's like rbenv or rvm for Ruby or virtualenv for Python, but it works for a bunch of different environments.

			- > A lot of laptops, like my beloved [[FrameworkCo/Laptop/13]], come with a fingerprint sensor to do authentication. You can use this with Omarchy by running *Setup > Security > Fingerprint* in the Omarchy menu (`Super + Alt + Space`). That'll install the fingerprint package, collect your print, verify it, and you'll be set to go using your fingerprint to unlock from the lock screen (which you can trigger with `Super + Escape`), enter sudo mode, and authorize system prompts.

			- > Thanks to [[Valve]]'s incredible work on [the proton compatibility layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_(software)), there are now tens of thousands of playable modern games on Linux. Oh, and did you know that the [[Steam/Deck]] actually runs Arch!
