- # Operator
	- A symbol or keyword that performs operations on variables and values
	- Fundamental to programming language syntax
	- Used in various contexts including arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, and more
	- ## Definition
		- Operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on operands
		- Operands are the values or variables that operators act upon
		- Operators can be unary (one operand), binary (two operands), or ternary (three operands)
	- ## Operator Categories
		- ### Arithmetic Operators
			- Perform mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder
			- Examples: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
		- ### Comparison Operators
			- Compare values and return boolean results
			- Examples: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
		- ### Logical Operators
			- Perform logical operations: AND, OR, NOT
			- Examples: `&&`, `||`, `!`
		- ### Bitwise Operators
			- Perform operations on individual bits
			- Examples: `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`
		- ### Assignment Operators
			- Assign values to variables, often combined with other operations
			- Examples: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`
		- ### Other Operators
			- Language-specific operators for borrowing, dereferencing, pattern matching, error propagation, etc.
	- ## Operator Overloading
		- Many languages allow operators to be overloaded for custom types
		- Enables user-defined types to use standard operator syntax
		- Typically implemented through traits or interfaces
		- Example: In Rust, operators can be overloaded through traits like `Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, etc.
	- ## Language-Specific Implementations
		- Different languages have different operator sets and behaviors
		- Some operators are overloadable, others are not
		- Operator precedence and associativity vary by language
