- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is a delightful alternative to something like the GitHub Desktop application, and it runs inside the terminal.
  
  You can run it directly, by going to any directory managed by git and running `lazygit`. Or you can run it inside Neovim where it can be started with `Space G G`.
  
  You hop between the different panes using `Tab`. In the Files pane, you select files for staging using `Space`, and then you can create a new commit using `c`. You can see all the commands available using `?`.
