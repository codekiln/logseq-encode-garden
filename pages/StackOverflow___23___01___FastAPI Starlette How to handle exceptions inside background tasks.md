- # How to handle exceptions inside FastAPI/Starlette background tasks?
	- ## Question Summary
		- How to properly handle exceptions that occur in FastAPI/Starlette background tasks
		- What happens when an exception occurs in a background task
		- How to prevent unhandled exceptions from crashing the application
	- ## Key Points from Answer
		- Background tasks run after the response is sent, so exceptions cannot be sent back to the client
		- Global exception handlers (`@app.exception_handler`) don't catch background task exceptions
		- Best practice is to wrap task logic in try/except blocks:
			- ~~~python
			  def background_job():
			      try:
			          # ... do work ...
			      except Exception as e:
			          logger.error(f"Background task failed: {e}")
			  ~~~
		- Use proper logging instead of just print statements
		- Configure logging to flush before application exits
		- In development, ensure debugger is configured to catch exceptions in all threads
