- # [cldwalker/logseq-query](https://github.com/cldwalker/logseq-query)
	- `lq`, short for `logseq-query`, is a commandline tool for querying [logseq](https://logseq.com/) knowledge graphs. `lq` makes it easy to define custom datalog queries and rules and invoke them from the commandline. Rules and queries are just [EDN data](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) and can be composed to make complex queries easy to read and write.
