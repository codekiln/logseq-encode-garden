- # Is it possible to see the compaction text in [[Claude Code]]?
	- ## Answer
		- Yes, it is possible to see the compaction text in Claude Code. There are several methods available.
	- ## Methods to View Compaction Text
		- ### Immediate View After Compaction
			- Use **CTRL+O** on some terminal setups to see the full summary immediately after running `/compact`
			- This displays the compaction summary right after it's generated
		- ### View JSONL Transcript Files
			- Claude Code stores all conversation history, including compaction summaries, as `.jsonl` files locally
			- Location: `~/.claude/projects/[path]/[session_id].jsonl`
			- The compaction summary is saved in the logs with `type:summary`
			- You can open these files directly in a text editor to view the raw JSONL data
			- The original conversation is preserved with a "compact boundary" marker, so you can see both the summary and the original messages
		- ### Using Extraction Tools
			- **claude-code-log** – Converts JSONL files to readable HTML/Markdown
				- Install: `pip install claude-code-log` or use `uvx claude-code-log`
				- Features include session navigation, token usage tracking, and message filtering
				- [GitHub](https://github.com/daaain/claude-code-log)
			- **claude-code-transcripts** – Generates detailed HTML pages with summaries
				- Can be run with `uvx` if you have the uv package manager
				- Creates shareable HTML pages with multi-page transcripts

	- ## How Compaction Works
		- When you run `/compact`, Claude Code creates a summary of your entire conversation history
		- The summary is used as the new context for subsequent messages
		- The original conversation is **not deleted** – it's preserved with a "compact boundary" in the conversation file
		- This allows you to retrieve details from the original conversation if needed
		- Compaction can be triggered manually or automatically when context reaches ~95% of the 200,000 token limit
