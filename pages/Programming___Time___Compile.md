alias:: [[Compile-time]], [[Compile-time Evaluation]]

- # Compile-Time
	- Also known as: compile time, compilation time, compile-time evaluation
	- The phase of program development when source code is transformed into executable code by a compiler
	- Operations and evaluations that occur during compilation, before the program runs
	- ## Definition
		- The period during which a compiler processes source code
		- Includes syntax analysis, semantic analysis, type checking, optimization, and code generation
		- Errors and checks that occur during this phase are called "compile-time errors"
	- ## Key Characteristics
		- **Static Analysis**: The compiler analyzes code without executing it
		- **Type Checking**: Types are verified before execution
		- **Constant Evaluation**: Constant expressions are evaluated during compilation
		- **Optimization**: Code optimizations are applied before runtime
		- **Code Generation**: Source code is transformed into machine code or bytecode
	- ## Compile-Time Operations
		- ### Syntax Analysis
			- Parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
			- Detecting syntax errors
		- ### Semantic Analysis
			- Type checking and type inference
			- Scope resolution
			- Name resolution
		- ### Constant Folding
			- Evaluating constant expressions at compile-time
			- Example: `const x = 2 + 3` becomes `const x = 5` at compile-time
		- ### Macro Expansion
			- Processing macros and metaprogramming constructs
			- Template instantiation (in languages like C++)
		- ### Optimization
			- Dead code elimination
			- Inlining
			- Constant propagation
	- ## Compile-Time vs Runtime
		- **Compile-Time**: Errors caught before execution, constant values known, type safety enforced
		- **Runtime**: Program execution, dynamic behavior, user input processing
		- Many languages aim to catch as many errors as possible at compile-time
	- ## Language Examples
		- ### Rust
			- `const` values must be computable at compile-time
			- Type checking happens entirely at compile-time
			- Borrow checker operates at compile-time
		- ### C/C++
			- Template metaprogramming evaluated at compile-time
			- `constexpr` functions and variables
		- ### TypeScript
			- Type checking occurs at compile-time (transpilation)
			- No runtime type information
	- ## Benefits
		- **Early Error Detection**: Catch errors before deployment
		- **Performance**: Constant evaluation and optimization happen once, not on every execution
		- **Type Safety**: Prevent type-related errors before runtime
		- **Better Tooling**: IDEs can provide better autocomplete and error detection
