- # Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
	- ## Definition
		- DRY is a software development principle that states "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system"
		- The principle was first introduced by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book "The Pragmatic Programmer"
	- ## Core Concept
		- **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of knowledge should exist in only one place
		- **Avoid Duplication**: Don't copy code, data, or logic across multiple locations
		- **Maintain Consistency**: Changes to shared knowledge should propagate automatically
	- ## Benefits
		- **Reduced Maintenance**: Changes only need to be made in one place
		- **Consistency**: Eliminates inconsistencies that arise from duplicate code
		- **Easier Debugging**: Issues are easier to trace when logic exists in one location
		- **Improved Reliability**: Less chance of bugs from forgetting to update duplicates
	- ## Common Violations
		- **Copy-Paste Programming**: Duplicating code blocks across functions or files
		- **Magic Numbers/Strings**: Hard-coding the same values in multiple places
		- **Duplicate Business Logic**: Implementing the same rules in different parts of the system
		- **Repeated Configuration**: Same settings defined in multiple configuration files
	- ## Implementation Strategies
		- **Functions and Methods**: Extract common logic into reusable functions
		- **Constants and Enums**: Define shared values in a single location
		- **Configuration Management**: Centralize configuration in one place
		- **Templates and Inheritance**: Use design patterns to avoid code duplication
		- **Libraries and Modules**: Create reusable components for common functionality
	- ## Related Principles
		- **[[Software/Engineering/Principle/SOLID]]**: Single Responsibility Principle aligns with DRY
		- **[[Software/Engineering/Principle/KISS]]**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - DRY helps maintain simplicity
		- **[[Software/Engineering/Principle/YAGNI]]**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - Balance DRY with over-engineering
	- ## Caveats and Considerations
		- **Over-Abstraction**: Don't create unnecessary abstractions just to avoid duplication
		- **Premature Optimization**: Sometimes duplication is acceptable for clarity or simplicity
		- **Context Matters**: What constitutes "knowledge" can vary by context
		- **Balance with Other Principles**: DRY should be balanced with maintainability and readability
