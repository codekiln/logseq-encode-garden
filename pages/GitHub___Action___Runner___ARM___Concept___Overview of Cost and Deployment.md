- Below is a **total-cost-of-ownership (TCO) framework** intended for evaluating a potential migration from an x86-based CI and runtime stack to ARM-based infrastructure within a GitHub Enterprise organization.
- ## 1 Cost Pillars to Model
	- ### A. Build-runner minutes
		- Metrics: Minutes × price-per-minute, Utilization of included minutes
		- Typical ARM Savings (US-East-1): Savings vary by runner type
		- Considerations: Standard macOS-ARM runner utilizes included minutes but limited by low memory (7 GB) and compatibility issues. Larger Linux-ARM runners (~37% cheaper per minute compared to x86 counterparts).
	- ### B. Build-time performance
		- Metrics: Job execution time
		- Typical ARM Savings (US-East-1): 15–40% faster for CPU-intensive Python builds
		- Considerations: Native compilation on ARM generally yields faster builds, thus fewer billable minutes.
	- ### C. Production runtime (Fargate)
		- Metrics: vCPU-hours × CPU pricing, GB-hours × memory pricing
		- Typical ARM Savings (US-East-1): Approx. 20% savings on vCPU and memory
		- Considerations: AWS Graviton processors typically provide lower tariffs and better price-performance.
	- ### D. Enablement overhead
		- Metrics: Infrastructure and security setup effort
		- Typical ARM Savings (US-East-1): Variable
		- Considerations: Larger runners involve short-term enablement. Self-hosted ARM solutions require substantial initial infrastructure setup and maintenance overhead.
- ## 2 Scenario-Based TCO Example
	- ### Variables
		- Monthly build jobs: 4,000 (x86 baseline) vs 3,000 (Linux-ARM runner + Graviton, assuming 25% faster)
		- Runner cost per minute: $0.008 (standard) vs $0.010 (larger ARM)
		- Build cost: 4,000 × $0.008 = **$32** vs 3,000 × $0.010 = **$30**
		- Task runtime per month: 1,000 vCPU-hours (both scenarios)
		- Fargate CPU cost: $0.04048 per vCPU-hour (x86) vs $0.03238 per vCPU-hour (ARM)
		- Runtime cost: **$40.48** vs **$32.38**
		- Total Cost: **$72.48** vs **$62.38 (approx. 14% savings)**
	- *Based on public pricing in July 2025 (US-East-1); memory pricing excluded for brevity.*
- ## 3 Key Benefits
	- **Reduced marginal CI costs** when exceeding included minutes.
	- **Operational savings** from lower Fargate pricing on Graviton.
	- **Improved build and runtime performance** due to ARM architecture efficiencies.
- ## 4 Principal Challenges
	- ### Runner provisioning
		- Challenge: Finance authorization required for per-minute billing.
		- Recommended Mitigation: Submit a concise business case with cost projections for ARM runner approval.
	- ### Compatibility issues
		- Challenge: Potential incompatibility between macOS-ARM binaries and Linux-based deployments.
		- Recommended Mitigation: Prioritize Linux-ARM runners for Docker builds and maintain fallback options on x86 runners.
	- ### Complexity of self-hosted solutions
		- Challenge: Increased operational overhead for infrastructure maintenance.
		- Recommended Mitigation: Initially consider managed larger runners; assess self-hosted ARM infrastructure in subsequent phases.
	- ### Inconsistent tool support
		- Challenge: Limited ARM compatibility for some CLI tools.
		- Recommended Mitigation: Maintain dual architecture (x86 fallback) jobs as interim solutions while upstream compatibility improves.

- ## 6 Alternative Build Strategies
	- ### 6.1 Standard macOS‑ARM Runner
		- Billing multiplier: Each macOS runner minute consumes **10 standard minutes**.
		- Spec: 3 vCPU / 7 GB RAM / 14 GB disk (Apple Silicon).
		- Implications: Rapidly depletes the 50 k‑minute pool; memory‑constrained for Docker builds; outputs Mach‑O binaries unless cross‑compiling inside Docker.
	- ### 6.2 QEMU Emulation on x86 Runner
		- Approach: docker buildx with --platform linux/arm64 using QEMU emulation.
		- Speed impact: Builds **4–8× slower** than native ARM; 5–6× slower than native x86 baselines in community benchmarks.
		- Reliability: Occasional hangs and segmentation faults reported when building complex C/C++ wheels.
		- Cost impact: No per-minute multiplier applies; however, the increased wall-time may offset any cost advantage. Benchmark data suggests slower emulated builds can increase total usage minutes. Additionally, longer execution durations can raise the likelihood of CI timeouts or flakiness, particularly in multi-stage Docker builds or when compiling native extensions.
- ## Next Steps
	- **Assess current CI utilization** to determine monthly minute usage.
	- **Provision an initial larger ARM runner** with financial oversight.
	- **Pilot Docker build jobs** on the ARM runner and measure cost and time efficiencies.
	- **Deploy a parallel Fargate-ARM environment** for comparative runtime analysis.
	- **Develop and submit a comprehensive business proposal** based on pilot results.
