	- ## [[ChatGPT/Deep Research/Query]]
		- Given [[EdTech/Idea/LearnMark]], what precedents exist for What precedents exist for an LMS-agnostic format that an AI could both read and write?
	- ## [[ChatGPT/Deep Research/Response]]
		- # LMS-Neutral Course Content Formats for Portability and AI-Assisted Authoring
			- ## [[SCORM]] (Sharable Content Object Reference Model)
				- A long-standing standard (circa 2000) for packaging e-learning courses into a transferable ZIP file.
				- ### Neutrality & Interoperability
					- SCORM packages (typically a `.zip` with a manifest) can be imported into any SCORM-compliant LMS, making content portable across platforms
					- This addresses the early e-learning pain point of delivering the same content on multiple LMSs without custom rework
				- ### Hierarchical Structure
					- SCORM supports a course hierarchy via an **IMS Content Packaging manifest** (`imsmanifest.xml`)
					- Content is organized into a tree of *Sharable Content Objects ([[SCORM/SCO]]s)*, allowing modules/lessons inside a course
					- SCORM 2004 introduced *Sequencing and Navigation* rules, enabling prerequisites and branching
					- This hierarchy is mostly linear, but can represent modules > lessons if authored that way
				- ### Extensibility (Interactive Components)
					- SCORM content can include rich HTML, multimedia, and JavaScript
					- Virtually any web-based interactive (simulations, videos, quizzes) can be packaged
					- SCORM's built-in tracking is limited to quiz scores, statuses, etc., via a browser API
					- It lacks native support for modern app embedding or external web services
					- Content runs in the LMS's web frame and communicates through a JavaScript API (the **SCORM RTE**)
					- Beyond what the [[SCORM/SCO]]'s code does, SCORM doesn't itself provide interactive widgets or question types
				- ### Integration with LLMs (AI Authoring)
					- SCORM is not inherently designed for AI-assisted authoring
					- Content inside is typically HTML or Flash (in older courses)
					- An LLM could help generate the textual content or even code for interactions
					- Assembling a SCORM package requires technical steps (manifest, packaging) outside an LLM's direct scope
					- SCORM's format isn't easily editable as one text file
					- An AI would need to manipulate multiple files (or use an authoring tool's API)
					- While SCORM content can be *generated* by AI (via templates), SCORM as a standard doesn't facilitate dynamic AI-driven assembly
				- ### Openness & Adoption
					- SCORM is an open specification maintained by ADL, built on earlier standards (AICC, IMS)
					- It became the de facto standard in corporate e-learning
					- **SCORM 1.2** remains hugely popular even decades later
					- Virtually all major authoring tools (Articulate, Captivate, iSpring, etc.) and LMSs support SCORM
					- Its longevity means a massive library of SCORM content exists
					- Development halted after SCORM 2004 4th Ed., and ADL shifted focus to xAPI
				- ### Content Metadata
					- SCORM manifests can include metadata (using IEEE **Learning Object Metadata** standards)
					- Can include metadata about the course or SCOs – e.g., titles, descriptions, keywords, duration
					- In practice this is optional and often skipped by tools
					- SCORM doesn't have fields for things like "difficulty" or "prerequisite" in the runtime
					- Those would have to be handled by sequencing rules or externally
				- ### Real-World Usage
					- SCORM is ubiquitous in compliance and self-paced training
					- Example: a company might author a "Workplace Safety" training module and deliver the same `.zip` to clients with different LMSs
					- SCORM ensures it plays and tracks completion uniformly
					- Academic use is less (universities lean toward other standards)
					- Some higher-ed content (like publisher supplements) is offered as SCORM for LMS compatibility
					- SCORM's widespread use also means many legacy courses still rely on it
				- ### Technical Complexity & Tooling
					- A **key success factor of SCORM was the tooling ecosystem**
						- Non-technical users rely on authoring software that publishes SCORM packages
						- This hides the XML and API details
					- Without such tools, creating a SCORM package involves:
						- Hand-writing the manifest
						- Using the SCORM JavaScript API for tracking
						- A non-trivial task requiring web development skills
					- SCORM's runtime has known technical constraints:
						- Content must be launched from within the LMS (often in a browser iframe)
						- A constant internet connection is needed to report progress
						- Cross-domain restrictions historically made hosting content outside the LMS tricky
					- These complexities and SCORM's aging web technology (designed before mobile era) are why the industry considers SCORM "dated"
			- ## [[xAPI]] (Experience API, aka Tin Can API)
				- A modern e-learning data specification (released 2013) focused on recording learning *experiences* rather than packaging content
				- ### Neutrality & Interoperability
					- xAPI is platform-neutral by design
					- Content or devices report learning events as "Actor–Verb–Object" statements to a **Learning Record Store (LRS)**
					- Any xAPI-compliant LRS can accept statements from any source
					- This allows data exchange across different systems
					- Example: a simulator, a mobile app, and an LMS could all send records to the same LRS
					- This decoupling means learning content is not tied to an LMS at all
					- Enables experiences outside traditional platforms to be tracked in a standard way
				- ### Hierarchical Structure
					- xAPI itself does not define how course content is structured or sequenced
					- It's intentionally unopinionated about content organization
					- You might have a concept of courses and modules in your implementation
					- xAPI just sees statements
					- For structure, one must rely on an external model or profile (like cmi5 or a custom convention)
				- ### Extensibility
					- One of xAPI's strengths is its flexibility
					- It can capture virtually any learning experience:
						- Completing an e-learning module
						- Attending a workshop
						- Getting a high score in a game
						- Even "Joe *answered* Question 5 *incorrectly* after 30 seconds"
					- The vocabulary (verbs, activity types) can be extended or standardized via profiles
					- Because [[xAPI]] is [[json]]-based and web-friendly, it handles complex and informal learning activities
					- For instance, a flight simulator can send detailed xAPI statements about each maneuver
					- This makes xAPI ideal for rich data and analytics across diverse learning contexts
				- ### Integration with LLMs
					- xAPI could play a role in AI-assisted learning in two ways:
						- **Authoring** – an LLM could help generate xAPI statement patterns or simulate learner data for analysis
						- **Tutoring** – an AI tutor could log its interactions with a student via xAPI
					- However, xAPI does not assist in content creation directly (it's about tracking)
					- For AI-assisted content assembly:
						- xAPI's openness means an AI could rearrange content modules
						- Update how it tracks experiences
						- But there's no single file "course definition" for an AI to edit
					- In summary, xAPI is complementary to AI:
						- It supplies a rich data layer that AI tools can both use and contribute to
						- But an AI would need additional frameworks to structure a course using xAPI data
				- ### Openness, Standardization & Community
					- xAPI was developed via community effort (Project Tin Can)
					- Now an open standard (ANSI/CTA and [[IEEE/9274]])
					- Has a growing community of practice
					- Adoption is common in government and enterprise sectors that need advanced analytics
					- The U.S. DoD and many corporate L&D groups have embraced xAPI
					- Many LMS vendors have added basic xAPI/LRS support
					- Industry-wide adoption has been gradual
					- Reliance on "good old SCORM" persists in many organizations
				- ### Content Metadata
					- xAPI statements can include an "object definition" with metadata
					- Can include name, description, type, extensions for the activity being tracked
					- However, xAPI doesn't enforce any particular metadata schema
					- To represent things like prerequisites, estimated time, or difficulty:
						- One could use xAPI *profiles*
						- Or separate metadata statements
						- But there's no universal method
					- Often, such metadata is managed outside of xAPI
				- ### Real-World Usage
					- xAPI shines in **Learning Experience Platforms ([[LXP]])** and analytics scenarios
					- Example use cases:
						- Enterprise tracking learner progress through mixed resources:
							- LMS course (via SCORM or cmi5)
							- [[YouTube]] videos
							- VR training session
						- Academic research projects using xAPI for detailed learning interaction data
						- Museum or onboarding programs where experiences aren't confined to one system
				- ### Tooling & Implementation
					- Many authoring tools can publish content with xAPI tracking
					- They produce a "Tin Can package" with a `tincan.xml` config
					- There are dedicated tools for:
						- Sending xAPI statements from simulations
						- Physical devices (even RFID-triggered learning events)
					- Implementers often use xAPI client libraries (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
					- The LRS is a critical component
					- Products like Learning Locker, Watershed LRS handle storage and querying
					- The flip side of flexibility:
						- Analyzing xAPI data requires defining meaningful statements
						- Possibly custom reporting
						- A rich xAPI dataset is only as useful as your statement structure
				- ### Limitations
					- xAPI does not solve content interchange or launching by itself
					- Without a companion spec, an LMS doesn't natively "import an xAPI course"
					- This is why **cmi5** was created
					- Because xAPI is so general, there's potential inconsistency
					- Two providers might use different verbs for the same concept
					- This can hamper interoperability unless standardized profiles are used
					- Not all LMS fully embrace xAPI yet
					- Some treat it as an add-on for analytics rather than a SCORM replacement
			- ## [[cmi5]]
				- An emerging standard that bridges the gap between [[SCORM]]'s packaging/launch and xAPI's flexibility
				- In essence, cmi5 is *"xAPI packaged for [[LMSs]]"*
				- ### Neutrality & Interoperability
					- cmi5 defines rules and packaging format for any cmi5-compliant course
					- Can be imported into any cmi5-capable LMS and run with xAPI tracking
					- Designed as a *next-gen SCORM* by [[AICC]] and [[US/Gov/ADL]] experts
					- Like SCORM, distributed as a [[Compression/zip]] file with #XML manifest (`cmi5.xml`)
					- Upon import, LMS knows how to:
						- Launch the content
						- Establish an xAPI communication session
					- This means content authors can create once and deliver to multiple platforms
				- ### Hierarchical Structure
					- cmi5's manifest allows simple course structure
					- One or more **[[cmi5/Assignable Unit]] (AUs)** organized under a course
					- An [[cmi5/Assignable Unit]] AU is analogous to a [[SCORM/SCO]]
						- The manifest can group AUs
					- Can potentially have nested structure of blocks or chapters
					- Standardizes *sequencing and mastery rules* via "moveOn" attribute
					- Example moveOn values:
						- `moveOn: Completed`
						- `moveOn: Passed`
					- [[LMS]] marks it satisfied when learner's xAPI statements indicate completion
				- ### Extensibility (Interactive Components)
					- Because cmi5 content is essentially #xAPI content, inherits xAPI's extensibility
					- A [[cmi5/Assignable Unit]] could be:
						- Video
						- VR simulation
						- Website
						- Not limited to browser frame
					- The spec explicitly allows [[cmi5/Assignable Unit]]s that run outside a web browser
					- This means cmi5 can handle modern use cases:
						- Mobile apps
						- Serious games
						- IoT-based training
					- LMS provides launch parameters including secure token for xAPI statements
					- Once launched, [[cmi5/Assignable Unit]] is free to deliver any interactive experience
				- ### Integration with [[LLMs]]
					- cmi5 is relatively new and focused on interoperability
					- Direct AI integration isn't a core feature
					- However, **modular, marked-up content** could be leveraged by AI
					- An AI agent could:
						- Read cmi5 course structure from #XML
						- Understand learning sequence
						- Help author generate cmi5 manifests
						- Generate entire lessons
					- Since cmi5 is text-based (XML + JSON statements), it's more tractable for AI
					- Potential future uses:
						- AI-driven adaptive courses using cmi5
						- AI dynamically assembling AUs for personalized curriculum
						- Using cmi5 to package and launch them
				- ### Openness, Standardization & Adoption
					- Open specification governed by [[US/Gov/ADL]] and [[AICC]] consortium
					- Finalized around 2016
					- Adoption is in early stages but growing
					- Several popular authoring tools can export cmi5 packages:
						- [[Articulate/Storyline]]
						- [[EdTech/Co/Elb Learning/Lectora]]
						- [[EdTech/Co/dominKnow]]
					- Some LMS/LRS products support importing and launching cmi5:
						- [[EdTech/Co/RusticiSoftware/SCORM Cloud]]
						- [[EdTech/Co/Learning Pool/Learning Locker]]
						- [[EdTech/Co/Epignosis/TalentLMS]]
					- [[US/Gov/DoD]] actively encouraging cmi5 for future-proofing training content
					- Community and tooling not yet as mature as SCORM's
				- ### Content Metadata
					- cmi5 manifest isn't as feature-rich for metadata as some [[IMS]] standards
					- Primarily lists AUs with:
						- Identifiers
						- Launch URLs
						- moveOn criteria
					- Can include descriptive metadata:
						- Title
						- Description
					- Fields like tags, estimated time, difficulty level not in core spec
					- These can be added as:
						- Extension elements
						- Separate metadata xAPI statements
					- No widely adopted convention for metadata in cmi5 yet
				- ### Real-World Examples
					- Tech company adopting cmi5 for adaptive learning:
						- Each module ([[cmi5/AU]]) reports detailed interactions via xAPI
						- LMS can allow "testing out" based on prior performance
						- Uses cmi5's moveOn and xAPI data together
					- VR training program for warehouse safety:
						- VR app (AU) launches from LMS
						- Records user actions as xAPI
						- LMS marks complete when required actions done
						- cmi5 enables integration across various LMSs without custom work
				- ### Tooling & Complexity
					- From instructional designer perspective:
						- Similar to publishing SCORM or xAPI package
						- Tools package cmi5 XML automatically
					- For custom developers:
						- Need to create manifest
						- Guidelines and example libraries available
						- Ensure content calls xAPI "session start/terminate"
						- Use provided credentials
					- Compared to SCORM:
						- cmi5's XML is simpler
						- No detailed sequencing beyond moveOn
						- No separate metadata or packaging of resources
					- Testing requires [[xAPI/LRS]] environment
					- Developers use tools like [[US/Gov/ADL/CATAPULT]] for validation
				- ### Limitations
					- Main limitation is ecosystem maturity
					- Not every LMS supports cmi5 yet
					- Content providers still need SCORM for non-supporting LMSs
					- While powerful, analyzing data across many AUs can be complex
					- cmi5 kept scope narrow to encourage adoption
					- Doesn't solve:
						- Peer learning activities
						- Complex branching within single [[cmi5/AU]]
					- Often used with other approaches:
						- LTI tool inside cmi5-launched content
						- AI tutor calling xAPI alongside cmi5 statements
			- ## [[IMS/Common Cartridge]] (CC)
				- A content packaging format from 1EdTech (IMS Global)
				- Widely used in academia for course materials exchange
				- Think of it as a "course archive" that works across different [[LMSs]]
				- ### Neutrality & Interoperability
					- Common Cartridge is explicitly LMS-neutral
					- An instructor can:
						- Export course from one LMS as Common Cartridge (.imscc file)
						- Import it into another LMS
						- Preserve content and basic structure
					- Built on IMS Content Packaging
					- Defined ways to include:
						- Resources
						- Assessments
						- Discussion topics
					- Enables content migration when institutions:
						- Change platforms
						- Share content
					- Interoperability strongest for core content:
						- Pages
						- Files
						- Quizzes
				- ### Support for Hierarchical Structuring
					- Supports course hierarchy of:
						- Modules
						- Lessons
						- Items
					- Manifest can define logical structure
					- Maps to LMS navigation
					- Example structure:
						- Module 1:
							- Lesson pages A, B, C
							- Quiz
						- Module 2:
							- Lessons D, E, etc.
					- Hierarchical info preserved on import
					- Aligns with typical academic course outlines
					- More flexible than SCORM's sequence
					- Can include non-linear elements
				- ### Extensibility (Interactive & Pedagogical Elements)
					- Designed for variety of components:
						- Resources:
							- HTML content
							- Documents
							- Media files
						- Assessments:
							- Uses **[[IMS/QTI]]** for quizzes
							- Supports range of question types
							- Enables quiz migration between systems
						- Discussion & Assignments:
							- Can include forum topics
							- Assignment instructions
						- External Tools:
							- Common Cartridge v1.3 added LTI support
							- Called "Thin Common Cartridge" when mostly links
							- Can include pointers to external tools
						- Modularity:
							- Modular at course level
							- Can distribute single module as cartridge
				- ### Integration with LLMs
					- Not straightforward for end-users due to XML format
					- Behind the scenes, AI could:
						- Generate portions of cartridge
						- Convert Markdown to HTML for insertion
						- Read CC exports for analysis
						- Suggest improvements
						- Identify gaps
					- Could serve as interchange format:
						- Get content out of LMS
						- Process with AI
						- Put back in
					- Newer approaches (like **LearnMark**) aim for AI-friendly formats
				- ### Openness, Standardization & Adoption
					- Open standard under [[1EdTech]]
					- Multiple versions (1.0 through 1.3)
					- Wide adoption in educational LMSs:
						- [[Canvas]] uses CC as export format
						- [[Moodle]] and [[Blackboard]] support import/export
						- Many publishers provide course packages in CC
					- Focus on academic use cases differentiates from SCORM
					- IMS consortium continues updates:
						- [[IMS/Common Cartridge/Thin]]
						- [[IMS/Common Cartridge/Edubase]]
					- Popular in higher-ed but not ubiquitous like SCORM in corporate
				- ### Content Metadata
					- IMS manifest can carry metadata at various levels:
						- Course
						- Module
						- Item
					- Can use [[IEEE/LOM]] or [[Dublin Core Metadata]]
						- IEEE LOM (Learning Object Metadata) and Dublin Core are two prominent metadata standards designed to facilitate the description, discovery, and management of digital resources.
						- ### 🔍 Key Differences between IEEE/LOM and Dublin Core Metadata
						  collapsed:: true
							- | Aspect          | IEEE LOM                                         | Dublin Core                                  |
							  |-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
							  | **Purpose**     | Detailed description of learning objects         | General description of various resources     |
							  | **Structure**   | Hierarchical with nine categories                | Flat with 15 core elements                   |
							  | **Complexity**  | More complex, suitable for educational contexts  | Simpler, suitable for broad applications     |
							  | **Flexibility** | Allows for extensions and application profiles   | Designed for interoperability and simplicit |
							- Both standards serve to enhance the discoverability and management of resources, but they cater to different needs and disciplines.
					- Can describe:
						- Subject
						- Description
						- Educational level
					- Many [[EdTech/OER/Cartridge]]s include metadata for indexing
					- Can note prerequisites or intended learning time
					- But CC doesn't enforce prerequisites
					- Metadata is descriptive only
				- ### Real-World Usage
					- Academic settings:
						- Course portability
						- Content sharing
						- Open Courseware initiatives
						- LMS migration
					- Some corporate/government learning content
					- Best for varied content types:
						- Reading
						- Quizzes
						- Discussion prompts
				- ### Technical Complexity & Tooling
					- Instructor perspective:
						- Usually built-in feature in LMS
						- Export/import functionality
					- Developer perspective:
						- Requires working with [[IMS/Content Packaging]] XML
						- Tools and libraries available
						- [[Compression/zip]]-based like SCORM
						- Can include all media files
					- Complexities:
						- Different LMS support different features
						- Testing across platforms important
						- Thin Common Cartridge simpler but relies on external content
				- ### Limitations
					- May not capture everything in a course
					- Complex interactive content needs LTI links
					- Dynamic/adaptive features not represented
					- Fundamentally static snapshot
					- Granularity usually at course/chunk level
					- XML verbosity can be hurdle for AI workflows
					- Mostly seen in academia
			- ## Other Notable Standards and Emerging Formats
				- ### [[IMS/QTI]] (Question & Test Interoperability)
					- Widely used standard for assessment content
					- Platform-neutral #XML format
					- Often used with [[IMS/Common Cartridge]]
					- Supports structured items:
						- Multiple-choice
						- Essays
						- Technology-enhanced items
					- Includes scoring and feedback rules
					- Enhances modularity for test content
					- Some limitations on complex question types
				- ### [[IMS/LD]] Learning Design
					- Comprehensive specification for pedagogical designs
					- Can model:
						- Activities
						- Roles
						- Collaborative tasks
						- Conditional flows
					- Never gained wide traction
					- Remained mostly experimental
					- Too complex for widespread adoption
				- ### Standards Comparison
					- Standards are complementary and overlapping
					- Example combination:
						- Package content as cmi5
						- Use LTI for external tools
						- Track with xAPI data
					- Industry moving toward blended approach
				- ### [[EdTech/Idea/LearnMark]] ( or other [[Markdown]]-based formats)
					- Interest in simpler, text-based formats
					- Uses Markdown with YAML frontmatter
					- Benefits:

							- Courseware cross-compiler
							- Converts Markdown to [[edX/OLX]]
						- **[[LiaScript]]**:
							- Extends Markdown for interactive courses
							- Includes quizzes, multimedia
							- Browser-based rendering
					- Challenges:
						- Need adoption and standardization
						- Each tool has own syntax
						- LMS support needed
						- Interactive elements need HTML/scripts
