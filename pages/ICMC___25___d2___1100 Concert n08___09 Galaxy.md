- # Galaxy, for [[Instrument/Guzheng]], electronic music and visual media
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- 20:57 we're through the exposition
			- it began with stars in the background, now we're into geometric shapes
		- it's a bit saccharine / Hollywood for me at the moment
		- I love the instrument though! The piano accompaniment is interesting.
		- DONE attach #YouTube #Video
			- {{video https://youtu.be/UKXxU75CcHw}}
		- 21:03 this is evoking full on 1940s hollywood vides, very "glorious" and conservative
		- virtuosic shlock. I've played my fair share, don't get me wrong.
	- ## #Description
		- The starry sky has long been a symbolic medium for Chinese literati to express their emotions. This piece uses “stars” as its source of inspiration, with the sound of the Zheng metaphorically conveying the connection between “stars” and “hearts.” The work experimentally incorporates AI technology: using AI visual algorithms and real-time timbre rendering algorithms, the performer can break free from the limitations of physical instruments and play virtual instruments in the air. The performer can not only control pitch, duration, dynamics, and articulation with precision in space but also perform operations like timbre switching and effect changes that are impossible in conventional performances.
