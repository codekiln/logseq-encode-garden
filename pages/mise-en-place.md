- ## history of term
	- The origins of mise-en-place date back to 19th-century France, where formal culinary training and professional kitchens began to emerge. One of the earliest recorded references to the principles behind mise-en-place can be tied to chefs such as Auguste Escoffier. Escoffier, often referred to as the father of modern cuisine, standardized many cooking practices in his seminal works, including "Le Guide Culinaire," published in 1903. Escoffier's emphasis on organization and preparation—principles that are integral to mise-en-place—helped shape modern culinary education and kitchen operations.
	  
	  In the 20th century, culinary schools such as the Culinary Institute of America and Le Cordon Bleu began incorporating mise-en-place as a foundational concept in their training programs. Notably, chefs like Julia Child popularized French cooking techniques, including mise-en-place, through their television shows and cookbooks. Child's influence brought attention to the importance of preparation in achieving successful cooking, making it more accessible to home cooks.
	  
	  Modern chefs continue to highlight the significance of mise-en-place. Prominent chefs like Thomas Keller, known for his meticulous approach to cooking at his renowned restaurants, frequently stress the importance of organization and preparation. In his book "The French Laundry Cookbook," Keller elaborates on mise-en-place as a philosophy that extends beyond the kitchen, advocating for mindfulness and care in all culinary endeavors.
	  
	  In summary, the term "mise-en-place" carries a rich history that connects to the evolution of culinary practices in France and beyond. Key figures such as Auguste Escoffier, Julia Child, and Thomas Keller have played essential roles in promoting its importance, ensuring that the concept remains a staple in both professional and home kitchens today.
