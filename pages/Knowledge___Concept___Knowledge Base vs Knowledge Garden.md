- # [[Knowledge Gardens]] vs [[Knowledge Bases]]
	- In the context of a product, organization or a company, the equivalent of a **Knowledge Garden** (KG) is often called a **Knowledge Base** (KB). Key differences between a Knowledge Garden and a KB are the:
		- **purpose** - KGs serve individual needs, while KBs are often an important form of official #Documentation needed by many different types of product stakeholders. A [[Software/Library]]'s documentation is a type of KB.
		- **number of contributors** - KGs are typically bespoke and managed by no more than a few people, whereas KBs might be updated in a team- or company-wide fashion
		- **level of formality** - KGs are typically more idiosyncratic and personal, while KBs are more impersonal and codified. For example, standards like #Diataxis codify how to create a KB for a product, but the [[Target/User]] or [[Target/Audience]] don't make quite as much sense in a context of personal [[Note-taking]].
