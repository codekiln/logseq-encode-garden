- # How to determine which [[GitHub/Issue/Status]] closes the issue in a Project
	- ## Overview
		- GitHub Projects allows custom status fields to track issue progress
		- Status fields are created by GitHub and cannot be renamed
		- There is no explicit "terminal status" configuration in GitHub Projects
	- ## What Closes an Issue
		- Issues are closed through actions, not through Project status:
			- Manually closing the issue
			- Merging a PR that closes the issue (using keywords like "closes #123")
			- Using the GitHub API to close the issue
		- The Project status field is independent of whether an issue is closed
	- ## Status Field in Projects
		- Status is a single select field that can be customized with options
		- You can add/edit/remove status options
		- Status changes don't automatically close issues
		- Example project:
			- Backlog
			- Prep/Checkout
			- Prep/Gather Requirements
			- Prep/Researching
			- Prep/Planning
			- Work/Ready for Implementation
			- Work/In Progress
			- Work/Review/Needed
			- Work/Review/In Progress
			- Work/Review/Pre-Merge Checks
			- Completed
	- ## Best Practices

		- Use `status` to track workflow state, **not completion**
		- For completion tracking, use:
			- The issue's closed/open state
			- Milestones
			- Labels
		- Consider automating status updates based on issue events
