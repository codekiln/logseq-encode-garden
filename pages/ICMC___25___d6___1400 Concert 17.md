	- ## Did not witness
		- **837** *Hearing The Otherworld, for four gongs and transducers* — Tianfang Jia
			- Performers: Tianfang Jia, four gongs
			- Description: Hearing The Otherworld for solo performer with four gongs and transducers explores the interdependence of body, metal and loudspeaker. Physical gestures excite the gongs; transducers re-animate them; the resulting resonances form layers of sonic after-images, leaving only waves of vibration that resonate within and beyond.
			- Author bio: Tianfang Jia is a composer and sound-artist whose practice spans installation, performance and electro-acoustic composition. She is currently pursuing a PhD in Integrated Composition, Improvisation and Technology at the University of California Irvine under Douglas Geers and Suzanne Farrin.
		- **19** *Corporeality, for Tárogató live versus automaton on video* — Karl F. Gerber
			- Performers: Esther Lamneck, tárogató
			- Description: *Corporeality (in honor of Harry Partch)* (2024) sets a live tárogató against its algorithmically generated avatar. Video-tracked gestures drive a confrontation of human and machine, combining selected algorithms with performer improvisation.
			- Author bio: Karl F. Gerber began on electric bass and jazz, studied composition with Furrer, Haas and Czernowin, and explores hybrid instruments and computer-extended performance. Finalist, Guthman New Musical Instrument Competition 2023.
