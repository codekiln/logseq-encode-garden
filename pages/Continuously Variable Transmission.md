- ## Example #Bike
	- > A Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) on a bike functions by using a system of variable-diameter pulleys connected by a belt, allowing for seamless gear shifts across a wide range of ratios without any distinct steps between gears, essentially **providing an "infinite" number of gear options that can be adjusted smoothly while riding by twisting a shifter**; this means you can transition between high and low gears at any point without needing to click through specific gear positions like on a traditional bike.

		- The NuVinci CVT replaces [derailleurs](/wiki/Derailleur_gears "Derailleur gears") and other [internally geared hubs](/wiki/Hub_gear "Hub gear"), and provides a gear ratio range of about 350%, similar to that on [bicycles](/wiki/Bicycles "Bicycles") with 8- or 9-speed hub gears, or with double chain rings (most racing or fast road bicycles).[\[](#cite_note-12)
