					  If you need help setting things up you can ask community for help, or you can pay for it (which if its for your business you should be doing anyways).

			- Nextcloud started off like a dropbox replacement. **Files stored on the cloud (but YOUR cloud**, not someone elses). So your files are stored **on a server, in your house** (or somewhere else if you choose). You can then **sync those files to your local computer**. Any changes made locally get uploaded to the server. You can then have consistent files across your devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, and even web.
			- You can then share and collaborate.
			- Nextcloud has grown since. And now has a whole **series of connected collaborative tools, making it a closer competitor to Office 365** than Dropbox.
			- You can live edit office documents, share calendars, have **self-hosted chat**.
			- So yes, its like a NAS, and like Onedrive, and like Office365, and like Google Office. It can do all of those things. If you want it to.

			- Think about the Google suite. File sharing, photo backup, email integration, chat and video collaboration, and extensible with other plug-ins that do a variety of stuff.

			- Talk is e2ee text, audio video chat with groups. Can replace much of slack functionality

			- If you just want to sync files, I recommend just installing [[syncthing]] syncthing on a cheap server. If you are looking for more advanced file sharing/syncing, calendar, apps, etc, Nextcloud is the way to go.
