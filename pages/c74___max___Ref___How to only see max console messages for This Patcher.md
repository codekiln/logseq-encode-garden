	- **tl;dr:** in the max patcher console, make sure the `<P>` is illuminated yellow.

		- *I think that because the `<P>` isn't illuminated above, it means that we are getting the slider and newobj errors*

				- Actually, it's the same button but on the inspector tab instead of the console tab. Weird that they chose to overload that!
		- *The button is really weird, because the tooltip you see over the button doesn't reflect the state of the button, but rather, the action that will be taken if you click the button*
