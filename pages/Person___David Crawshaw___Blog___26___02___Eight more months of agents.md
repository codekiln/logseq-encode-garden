	- ## High-level takeaways
		- I 100% agree with most of this framing on the state of AI-assisted engineering: frontier model capability is moving quickly, practical workflows matter most, and teams that adapt their tooling around agents gain a real speed advantage.
	- ## Notes on the argument (summary + excerpts)
		- **Model progress is the main driver right now; harnesses matter, but capability jumps are coming mostly from frontier models.**
			- > "Right now, it is all about the model."
			- > "In February last year, Claude Code could write a quarter of my code. In February this year, the latest Opus model can write nine tenths of my code."
		- **The coding workflow is shifting away from IDE-centered interaction toward agent-centered interaction.**
			- > "In 2021, the IDE had won."
			- > "In 2026, I don't use an IDE any more."
			- > "The only IDE-like feature I use today is go-to-def... here I am, 2026, and I am back on Vi."
		- **Using weaker/cheaper models can teach the wrong operational instincts when the frontier keeps moving.**
			- > "if you try some penny-saving cheap model... you do worse than waste your time, you learn the wrong lessons."
			- > "you will not know what models will be capable of unless you use the best."
		- **Built-in safety sandboxes create too much friction for serious use; in practice, people bring their own isolated runtime.**
			- > "Built-in agent sandboxes do not work"
			- > "You have to turn off the sandbox, which means you have to provide your own sandbox... use a fresh VM."
		- **He is building `[[exe.dev]]` to make unconstrained, disposable VM-based agent execution practical for everyday one-liner ideas.**
			- > "This is why I am building exe.dev."
			- > "I need a VM, with an unconstrained agent, that I can trivially start up and type the one liner I would have otherwise put into an Apple Note named TODO and forgotten about."
			- > "A good portion of the time Shelley turns a one-liner into a useful program."
		- **His broader product thesis: customers now arrive with agents, so products should be easy for programmers (and thus agents) to compose against.**
			- > "I implemented that entire Stripe product (as it relates to me) by typing three sentences."
			- > "the best software for an agent is whatever is best for a programmer."
	- ## Personal annotations integrated
		- The points above line up with my own experience, including doing similar CLI-centric workflows (e.g., with `langstar`) instead of relying on heavy UI-first flows.
