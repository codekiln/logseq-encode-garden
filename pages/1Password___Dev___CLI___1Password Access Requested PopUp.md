		- ## [[My Notes]]
			- [[2025-04-21 Mon]] - like [[MacOS App Popup Access Data from Other Apps]], this pop-up doesn't reveal what is trying to be asked. IMO it would be preferable to have an ability to see the vault, item and field name - or the [[1Password Secret Reference]] - inside of the disclosure box, so we could verify that whatever process was requesting access was only getting access to specific items.
