			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 0}} Introduction to SpecKit
				- #### Project Overview
					- **SpecKit** is a new experimental project from GitHub
					- "16.3,000 stars... I was just celebrating yesterday that we hit 15,000 and it's 16.3,000 already a week after release"
					- Rapid community adoption and feedback
				- #### Community Engagement
					- Encourages feedback through GitHub issues
					- "Thank you to all of you who are trying this out, who are experimenting, who are filing issues, opening pull requests"
					- Warning about proper issue reporting: "do not open a pull request that rewrites the entire thing as an MCP server"
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 61}} What is Spec-Driven Development?
				- #### Problem with Vibe Coding
					- "vibe coding some SAS app and there's a lot of this imprecision happening"
					- "You end up in these random rabbit holes where the code is not quite what you wanted"
					- "The implementation is not quite what you wanted. The design is not quite what you wanted"
				- #### Spec-Driven Development Solution
					- "spec driven development is something that can actually help you get out of that rabbit hole"
					- "into a little bit more of a scalable solution for your software"
					- Focus on **what** and **why** rather than **how**
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 120}} Getting Started with SpecKit
				- #### Installation Options
					- **CLI Installation** (recommended):
						- "use uvx and you can install it directly from the GitHub repo"
						- "Shout out to the folks at Astral. UVX. I use UV and UVX all the freaking time"
					- **Manual Download**:
						- "if you do not want to use a CLI, that's totally fine"
						- "you can go to the releases and just download the templates yourself"
				- #### Supported Agents
					- GitHub Copilot
					- Cloud Code
					- Gemini CLI
					- **Cursor** (newly added): "just today, actually, I launched support for Cursor"
					- PowerShell and shell scripts for different operating systems
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 170}} Project Bootstrap Demo
				- #### Creating a Podcast Website Project
					- Project name: "pod site"
					- "I am big at podcasting. If you have not listened to the work item, check it out"
					- Using GitHub Copilot as the selected agent
				- #### Script Selection
					- "defaults smartly to the operating system that you're running in"
					- PowerShell for Windows, shell scripts for Linux/Unix
					- "this just launched today. It's hot off the press. You can actually now support PowerShell"
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 333}} Project Structure and Constitution
				- #### Generated Project Structure
					- `specify/` folder with metadata, scripts, and templates
					- `GitHub/` folder with prompts for slash commands
					- Helper scripts for deterministic operations
				- #### Constitution File Concept
					- "establishes a set of non-negotiable principles for your project"
					- Examples: "I always have to have tests. I always got to make sure that I'm running Next.js of a specific version"
					- "you encode that in the constitution"
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 438}} VS Code Integration
				- #### Slash Commands
					- `/specify` - Define baseline specification
					- `/plan` - Specify technical requirements  
					- `/tasks` - Break down work into manageable chunks
					- "slash commands in VS Code is nothing other than custom prompts"
				- #### Model Selection
					- "I like GPD5 and cloud sonnet 4 personally"
					- "depending on what you're building and the scope of things that you're building you might want to customize that"
					- GPT-5 for spec scaffolding, Sonnet 4 for creative output
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 668}} Constitution Setup
				- #### AI-Generated Constitution
					- "fill the constitution with the bare minimum requirements for a static web app"
					- Three key principles established:
						- **Static first delivery**: "no static first delivery, no serverside execution"
						- **Simplicity over tooling**: "Prefer vanilla HTML, CSS, JS"
						- **Accessibility and SEO baseline**
				- #### Manual Editing Capability
					- "This can bootstrap it. It doesn't mean that you cannot do this manually"
					- Constitution is editable markdown file
					- "you can just keep them inside this specify folder"
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 898}} Specification Creation
				- #### Using /specify Command
					- "define the baseline specification... the what and the why"
					- "We're not focusing on a technical requirements"
					- "completely detached from the implementation"
				- #### Podcast Website Requirements
					- "modern podcast website to look sleek"
					- Landing page with one featured episode
					- Episodes page, about page, FAQ page
					- 20 episodes with mocked data
					- "we're just establishing the requirements. We're detaching ourselves from the technical details"
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 1089}} Git-Based Workflow
				- #### Branch Management
					- "it switched to a new branch because, as I mentioned, this is git based"
					- "using these custom branches to help you organize your work"
					- "you're not damaging anything in production and you can always roll back changes"
				- #### Specification Artifacts
					- Generated specification in `specs/` folder
					- User scenarios and testing guidelines
					- Functional requirements and acceptance criteria
					- "review and acceptance checklist. This is key here"
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 1327}} Technical Planning
				- #### Using /plan Command
					- "specify the technical requirements"
					- "Next.js with static site configuration. No databases"
					- "make sure that the site is responsive and ready for mobile"
				- #### Plan Artifacts
					- Execution flow and technical context
					- Primary dependencies and target platform
					- Constitution checks and architecture requirements
					- Research artifacts and data model outline
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 1451}} Task Breakdown
				- #### Using /tasks Command
					- "break the work down into manageable chunks that the agent can tackle one by one"
					- Test-driven development approach
					- "Test first must fail before implementation"
				- #### Task Phases
					- Setup: Initialize Next.js app skeleton
					- Core implementation after tests are failing
					- About page, FAQ page, episodes page
					- Integration refinement with Lighthouse testing
					- Polish: responsive images, documentation, accessibility
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 1803}} Implementation Process
				- #### Model Switching Strategy
					- "switch my model to Cloud Sonnet 4 because I like this the most for code"
					- "GBD5 is good at setting up the spec scaffolding for us, but for creative output, Sonnet 4 is still unbeatable"
				- #### Automated Implementation
					- "implement the tasks for this project and update the task list as you go"
					- Agent runs through all tasks automatically
					- "Let the agent run wild and go and implement our website"
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 2030}} Final Results and Benefits
				- #### Generated Website
					- "Tada. Looks like it did it. It finished the work"
					- Podcast website with featured episode, about page, FAQ, episodes list
					- "it's not bad. master the art of podcasting"
				- #### Spec-Driven Development Advantages
					- **Structured approach** vs. vibe coding
					- "now that I have the spec, now that I have the artifacts here in my spec implementation, I can easily customize it"
					- "makes it easier for me to then reimplement and rebuild things and additively add features in a structured way"
					- **Context preservation** for consistent software development
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 2187}} Future Enhancements and Community
				- #### MCP Integration
					- "if I plug in MCP tools like Figma MCP, I can link to actual design"
					- "get it to build things that fit the design system of my organization"
				- #### Community Feedback
					- "this is not a production scenario... there's a lot for us to learn"
					- "We want your feedback. We want your input"
					- "if something breaks, if something doesn't work, if something that it produces is garbage, let us know"
				- #### Next Steps
					- "go to github.com/github/spec-kit. Download it. Use it. Tell me what's wrong"
					- "next video where we're going to talk about more complex things"
					- Experimentation and iterative improvement approach
