# [Semantic Line Breaks](https://sembr.org/)
	- [[sembr/GitHub/specification]]
		- [sembr/specification: Semantic Line Breaks Specification](https://github.com/sembr/specification)
			- a compatibility [[Specification]] for markup language about adding line breaks after each substantial unit of thought.
				- #Example
					- **Instead of** being forced to write
						- `All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.`
					- a language that supports `sembr` will **also** support writing
						- ```
						  All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
						  They are endowed with reason and conscience
						  and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
						  ```
					- and despite these changes, the final rendered output will render the same:
						- > All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
