# [VS Code Themes](https://vscodethemes.com/)
	- view screenshots of themes, then try them out in [[VSCode/.dev]] `vscode.dev` online. Very useful for trying out themes without installing each of them as a [[VSCode/Extension]]
		- [example of testing at vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/felipe-mendes.slack-theme/Slack%20Theme%20Aubergine)
	- I do wish it had more than one screenshot
	- it is possible to switch from theme to theme
