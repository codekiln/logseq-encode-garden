# Webinar: From Code Completion to Multi-Agent Coding Workflows - building [[QodoAI]] with [[langgraph]]
	- ## Intro - [[Person/Itamar Friedman]]
		- [[My Notes]]
			- Says that they would have built Qodo in [[langgraph]] if it had been available
			- [[System 2]]
				- aware of environment
			- Trad vs agentic AI
				- agentic - multi-step, autonomous
			- they launched qodo gen 1.0 in [[JetBrains]] etc
			- mentions [[AlphaCodium]]
	- ## Next - [[Person/Harrison Chase]]
		- [[My Notes]]
			- you made some comment about how langgraph came a day after [[AlphaCodium]]
				- [[Flow Engineering]] stuck with him at that time, he uses that term all the
	- ## [[Person/Itamar Friedman]]
		- [[My Notes]]
			- original code was AlphaCode by [[DeepMind]]
	- ## Demo 1 - something simple
		- [[My Notes]]
			- ### [[Person/Yoav Orlev]]
				- [[My Notes]]
					- Qodo Gen extension on left in [[VSCode/Q]]
						- Question he asks it: best web frameworks in python ...
					- it generates an "artifact"
						- they are printing it as a new file to see it
					- you generate the diff *after* and then apply it to the file
			- ### [[Person/Itamar Friedman]]
				- [to yoav] you should hint at stability in a way that leads to [[langgraph]] above
			- ### [[Person/Yoav Orlev]]
				- we like [[langgraph]] to leverage the IDE
				- this is a structured flow, not a single node
				- we're widening this to see if we wanted to have test generated code
			- ### [[Person/Itamar Friedman]]
				- this is first time we're showing this
			- ### [[Person/Harrison Chase]]
				- are all the tools #MCP based?
			- ### [[Person/Itamar Friedman]]
				- the one we use internal ... follow the same interface
			- ### [[Person/Harrison Chase]]
				- asks if they actually have same interface or same [[MCP/Server]] under hood
			- [[Person/Yoav Orlev]]
				- smaller toolsets are more accurate
			- [[Person/Itamar Friedman]]
				- you can be a bit specific as you learn to prompt
				- being a bit verbose with what you want you can get up to 33 tools
				- not sure if up to 100 will work well
	- ## Demo 2 - #MCP with [[Playwright]]
		- [[Person/Yoav Orlev]] is using [[ArcBrowser]]
		- doesn't go very well; the chromium browser doesn't pop up
		- [[Person/Itamar Friedman]] mentions that it *usually* opens in the background
	- ## Discussion of frameworks
		- a bunch of discussion here
	- ## Challenges with #LangGraph
		- ### [[Person/Yoav Orlev]]
			- talks about docs challenges with #Documentation around [[langgraph/Streaming]]
			- [[Person/Harrison Chase]]
				- talks about
	- ## Things that work well
		- [[LangSmith]] "I don't think we would manage to get where we are without
		- ### [[Person/Harrison Chase]]
			- mentions that we "used to have a desktop version" [[langgraph/Studio]]
	- ## Where is it going next
		- ### [[Person/Harrison Chase]]
			- MCP is like agent to tools, but [something] is like agent to agent
	- ## Talking about [[MCP]]
		- [[Person/Itamar Friedman]]
			- original documentation about mcp was about fetching context
			- *there are some problems with using MCP with agent to agent*
	- ## My Questions from the Discussion
		- How does MCP fit into the architecture? Specifically:
			- How many servers were created vs. reused?
			- How are prompts versioned within MCP server definitions?
			- What best practices were learned for versioning MCP servers?
		- Is there a good pattern for abstracting custom streaming away from the graph definition in LangGraph?
			- LangGraph's integration with the application appears tightly coupled to the graph architecture, limiting flexibility.
			- Are there strategies to mitigate this coupling?
		- How does LangSmith play into LLM system evaluation with LangGraph?
			- How are datasets structured in this process?
		- How does the "agent-to-agent" paradigm relate to MCP clients acting as both servers and clients?
			- How does this enable chaining agents together while keeping inference controlled by the client application?
		- Does Qodo have something similar to "Cursor Project Rules" that allows steering its functionality?
			- What are the abstractions around this, if any?
		- What best practices exist for managing scoped permissions with MCP servers?
			- Other than using finely grained permissions, are there strategies for handling permissions across multiple projects?
			- Each MCP server needs its own permissions—how can this be streamlined?
			- Is "context credential ops" on Qodo’s product development radar?
