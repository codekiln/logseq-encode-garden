- # `caffeinate` command
	- ## Overview
		- Built-in macOS command-line utility that prevents the system from sleeping
		- Part of the macOS system since OS X Mountain Lion (10.8)
		- Operates at the system level, more powerful than GUI alternatives
		- Note: This is different from [[CaffeineApp]] (the GUI application)
	- ## Basic Usage
		- `caffeinate [options] [command]`
		- When run without a command, keeps the system awake until interrupted (Ctrl+C)
		- When run with a command, keeps the system awake while the command executes
	- ## Common Options
		- `-d` - Prevent display from sleeping
		- `-i` - Prevent system from idle sleeping
		- `-m` - Prevent disk from idle sleeping
		- `-s` - Prevent system from sleeping (only if AC power adapter is connected)
		- `-u` - Simulate user activity and prevent display from sleeping
		- `-t <seconds>` - Timeout after specified number of seconds
		- Options can be combined (e.g., `-di` prevents both display and system sleep)
	- ## Examples
		- ### Keep system awake indefinitely
			- `caffeinate` - Run until interrupted (Ctrl+C)
			- `caffeinate -t 3600` - Keep awake for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
		- ### Keep system awake for a specific duration
			- `caffeinate -t 1800` - Stay awake for 30 minutes
		- ### Prevent display sleep while system can sleep
			- `caffeinate -d` - Keep display awake (useful when connected to external monitor)
		- ### Keep system awake during a command execution
			- `caffeinate make build` - Keep awake while building
			- `caffeinate -d -i npm run test` - Prevent display and system sleep during tests
			- `caffeinate -u -t 7200 python long_script.py` - Simulate user activity for 2 hours while script runs
		- ### Combined options for maximum wakefulness
			- `caffeinate -di` - Prevent both display and system idle sleep
			- `caffeinate -dim` - Prevent display, system, and disk idle sleep
	- ## Common Use Cases
		- Preventing sleep during long-running builds or tests
		- Keeping system awake during large downloads
		- Maintaining wake state during automated scripts
		- Preventing sleep during presentations or demos
		- Running overnight processes or backups
	- ## Comparison with GUI Alternatives
		- More scriptable and automatable than [[CaffeineApp]]
		- Can be integrated into build scripts and automation
		- No installation required (built into macOS)
		- Better suited for command-line workflows
