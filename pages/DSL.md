- # Domain-specific languages (DSLs)
	- Languages designed for specific tasks/domains.
	- Examples:
		- [[SQL]] – for relational database queries
		- [[Regex]] – for text pattern matching
		- [[HTML]] – for web layout
		- [[CSS]] - for web design
		- [[Makefile]] – for build automation
		- [[LaTeX]] – for document preparation
		- [[Datascript]] / [[Datalog]] – for logic-based data querying
	- These are sometimes **declarative**, expressing *what* you want rather than *how* to compute it.
