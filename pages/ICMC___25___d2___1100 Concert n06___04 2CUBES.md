	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- #Wow - such a cool interface!
			- fun to listen to, watch, I'm amazed.
			- The whole interface augments what's possible.
			- 4d chess.
			- DONE attach #YouTube #Video

			- what is going to be possible soon?
			- deep bass thumps are almost frightening, - they are not thumps, they are like reverberating thuds - there's some kind of arrow on the ball, and the bassisis puncturing our eardrumbs by pointing at the surface.
			- it's an uncanny valley situation, the way the model of their hands map onto their hands
			- some rhythmic - cuban roots -
			- the perception of intentionality is so key to musical appreciation
			- as [[Person/Hyunkyung Shin]] saws away at her double bass, an organ sound emerges, and the model of the hands lags behind
			- [[Person/Henrik von Coler]] has an "EDC" hat on ... ?

			- **Henrik von Coler** is a composer/performer of electronic music and researcher. From 2015-2023 he was director of the TU Studio (TU Berlin). He is now an Assistant Professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Music, where he is running the Lab for Interaction and Immersion (L42i). His research encompasses spatial audio, human-computer – and human-human interaction and live electronics. In his performances and compositions, he combines state of the art digital systems with analog and simple sound generators to create immersive experiences with digital to organic textures and timbres.
		- [[Person/Hyunkyung Shin]]
			- **Hyunkyung Shin** is a composer, bassist, and researcher in music technology, currently pursuing a master’s degree at the [[School/Georgia Institute of Technology]]. Her research focuses on spatial audio, sonic interaction, and multimodal interface design within immersive media, with particular emphasis on human-computer interaction and user experience in AR/VR environments. As a composer and bassist, she explores embodiment and improvisation through spatialized sound and gestural control. Her performances have been featured at international festivals and conferences including ICMC, NYCEMF, and OHBM.
	- ## #Description
		- 2CUBES is a live-electronic performance for [[Double Bass]], modular synth and two Augmented Reality (AR) interfaces. The musicians are wearing [[Reality/Virtual]] head-mounted displays (HMDs), to interact with a virtual cube – programmed in [[Unity]], that is placed next to their instruments. This interface allows them to manipulate the sounds of their instruments and distribute them in space with Ambisonics rendering – all realized in SuperCollider. The HMDs also capture the first-person view of both musicians and stream them to the audience using GEM in [[PureData]], which enables a direct connection between the instruments’ sounds and the visuals. This new perspective creates a completely new experience for the audience, revealing the minute movements, even for the modular synth. 2CUBES is a structured improvisation that explores the possibilities of the instruments in combination with the interface and the spatial rendering system.
