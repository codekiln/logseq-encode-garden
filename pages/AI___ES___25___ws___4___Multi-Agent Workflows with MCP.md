			- Agents aren't really agents unless they can discover the world outside of the chatbox, and act on it -- and the MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an emerging standard for connecting agents to physical and digital worlds. This workshop will teach you how to build your own MCP client (not just the one built into Claude) and connect it to a multi-agent system (we'll be using [[langgraph]] but this approach works with Autogen, Crew AI and many more). This allows you to build powerful workflows that go way beyond writing code, and rethink how to express business logic as a set of roles, tools, and desired outcomes. We'll walk through examples together and then put them into practice -- come with ideas of workflows you want to build! [List of existing MCP servers here]

	- ### [[Key Insight]] - #MCP is #Lego
	- #langgraph is the easiest to explain of all the frameworks #Quote -- [[Person/Dan Mason]]
		- it is #Expensive at least it gan me
		- it is model agnostic
	- [[GitHub/CoPilot]] is at the bottom of the pile but
