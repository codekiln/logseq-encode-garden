- # [6.3 Launching the Arrangement with Locators](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/11/arrangement-view/#launching-the-arrangement-with-locators)
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- [[2025-05-13 Tue]] decided that some
			- sensible default key shortcuts for the Set, Previous Locator and Next Locator button are:
			  id:: 6823088d-fa5b-4a59-99c1-f6d211a63f9d
				- `[`: go to **previous** locator
				- `]`: go to **next** locator
				- `\`: **set** a locator
			- These are not mapped by default, and need to be set with [MIDI/key mapping](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/11/midi-and-key-remote-control/#midi-and-key-remote-control)
	- ![Locator controls](https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/11/LocatorControls.png?auto=&w=396)
	- > You can recall (jump to) locators by clicking on them, or with the Previous and Next Locator buttons below the Set button. Locators can also be recalled usingÂ [MIDI/key mapping](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/11/midi-and-key-remote-control/#midi-and-key-remote-control).
