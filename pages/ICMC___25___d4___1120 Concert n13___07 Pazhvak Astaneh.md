		- #Short
			- Micro-tonal viola lines trigger realtime spectral processing and synchronized light pulses, tracing the threshold ("Astaneh") between acoustic breath and electro-luminous after-image.
		- #Long
			- ***Pazhvak Astaneh.*** This work explores the delicate, sometimes imperceptible transitions we encounter when placed in new spaces—whether social or physical. These moments of adjustment often hold the potential for transformation, as new possibilities quietly take shape. In the piece, these ideas are expressed through the evolving relationship between space, material, and processing, creating a fluid sonic dialogue where shifts in spatial perception transform the behavior of both sound and its treatment.

		- #Bio/Long
			- **Pedram Diba** (b. 1993) is an Iranian-American composer whose work is defined by the creation and evolution of intricate relationships between various sonic elements. His music has been praised for its “powerful interaction and striking richness of components” (ResMusica, France) and described as “showing a deep sense of musical energy and great attention to the organicity and morphological profiles of sound” (Pierre Jodlowski). Diba’s works have been featured at festivals and conferences including SEAMUS, IRCAM Forum, Splice, and New Music Gathering, and performed at prominent venues such as the DiMenna Center in New York, Le CENTQUATRE-PARIS, Constellation Chicago, and Le Gesù in Montreal. Since 2019, Diba has been a member of the Analysis, Creation, and Teaching of Orchestration (ACTOR) Project, an international partnership that advances research and practice in timbre and orchestration through interdisciplinary collaboration. Within ACTOR, he has contributed to projects such as the CORE Ensemble Project, Musicians Auditory Perception (MAP), and Space As Timbre (SAT), exploring new ways to integrate technology, the spatial qualities of sound, and collaborative practices in contemporary music creation. He earned his B.M. in composition from the University of Oregon, where he was recognized as the Outstanding Undergraduate Scholar in Composition. Following this, he pursued his M.M. at McGill University under the mentorship of Philippe Leroux, supported by the Max Stern Fellowship in Music. His studies continued at IRCAM, where he completed the Cursus de composition et d’informatique musicale under the guidance of Pierre Jodlowski and Claudia Scroccaro. Currently, he is pursuing his Ph.D. in composition and music technology at Northwestern University, working with Alex Mincek, Hans Thomalla, and Jay Alan Yim. ​ Diba’s music is published by BabelScores in both digital and printed formats.
