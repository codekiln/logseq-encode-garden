# Taideji
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- 21:02 [[Person/Lara Morciano]] is at left in a sparkly outfit with her arm inside the piano, ravvaging it.
		- [[Person/Thierry Miroglio]] is at the right with a full percussion kit
		- [[Person/Jose Miguel Fernandez]] is on laptop
		- 21:04 some sounds like corks being pulled out slowly,
		- then some beads are shaken and turn into skittering slips
		- they are really playing with [[Somax2]] here - it feels alive. I wonder how much the laptop artist [[Person/Jose Miguel Fernandez]] is doing here. is he controlling hyperparameters, using live samples, etc?
		- I like the stuttering spiral of the snare that somax is spinning around the room with samples from thierry
		- this is such a great space for this concert!
		- the snare is traveling around with incredible force, like a train in a circle
		- now the drums back off, and we get the piano
		- clusters of chunks are dashed and chopped, speeding up samples of her grinding on the lower strings earlier.
		- i swee that jose has some kind of controller now.
		- ooh, now we have to get our ears opened to these electronic buzzes, that explode with wet lips, while [[Person/Thierry Miroglio]]'s bells and maraca stokes into a rattlesnake's spin,
			- snare starts and comes across thierry's stick and out into the room, spinning out,
			- ooh, now some low toms sound even weirder with somax2's processing
			- wow, this is really cool, now the snares are getting split apart some how?
			- hard to say what I mean, but it's like the 4-5 snare beats get lengthened and changed in timing, becoming a texture.
		- i think this was one of my favorite piecess so far in the concert. it's playful, serious, there's enough room in the hall (enough empty space for things to resonate and breathe)
		- 21:13 spooky piano dreams from [[Person/Lara Morciano]]'s gentle submissions to [[Somax2]]. very spooky. didn't expect to end up here.
		- when you have 8 channels, when do you *not* decide to spin a sound around the room?

		- ### [[Person/Jose Miguel Fernandez]] #Performer
			- **José Miguel Fernández** is a composer and researcher. He studied music and composition at the University of Chile and the LIPM in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He later pursued advanced composition studies at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Lyon and completed the IRCAM Cursus in composition and computer music. His work spans instrumental, electroacoustic, and mixed music. His compositions have been performed across the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Oceania, and he has taken part in numerous international festivals. He was selected for the Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition and received both the GRAME–Ensemble Orchestral Contemporain International Composition Prize in Lyon and the Giga-Hertz Award from ZKM/EXPERIMENTALSTUDIO in Germany. In 2021, he earned a Ph.D. in music (composition as research) from Sorbonne University/IRCAM. He is currently engaged in postdoctoral research on Somax2, an AI-based system for composition and co-improvisation, within the RepMus team at IRCAM. His research focuses primarily on electronic music composition, improvisation, and the development of new tools for mixed and electroacoustic music. Alongside his compositional work, he is actively involved in pedagogical and creative projects integrating computer music.
	- ## #Description
		- ##### 
		  
		  In Taideji, the collaboration between the performers is rooted in an exploration of the dynamic relationship between acoustic instruments and electronics, incorporating the interactive possibilities offered by Somax2.
		  
		  The sonic palette of the piano at times low, distorted, and percussive, at others bright and resonant, interacts with the rich colors of the percussion, shaping a musical journey marked by strong contrasts and an ever-shifting energy, oscillating between density and rarefaction.
		  
		  On the electronic side, the two acoustic instruments are processed in real time through various techniques, while Somax2 establishes a sensitive and reactive connection between instrumental performance and generated sound material, enriching the dialogue between human and machine.
