	- ## #Description
		- **Continuum** refers to the gradual transition between two things. In this work, the concept of “spacetime continuum” from physics is borrowed, and sound parameters are calculated and transformed using the Lorenz equations. This is combined with a 3D audio presentation, allowing the narrative of the music to continuously transition and transform between time and space. It explores the relationship between the dimensions of time and space in music and human perceptual expectations from both a physical and psychological perspective, showcasing the multiple dimensions of music and exploring the intersection of music and science.
