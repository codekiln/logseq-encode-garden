			- it's flipping around us

	- ## #Description

			- An electroacoustic work that explores the rich musical traditions of Arab culture through the lens of contemporary electronic music, blending traditional maqam scales with modern sound design techniques.
		- #Long
			- **Taqism / The Humanity of Arabs**
				- In a time when it seems difficult for some even to concede the humanity of certain Arabs
				- draws from Arabic musical materials
				- All electronic material is generated and controlled in real-time
					- see accompanying ICMC 2025 paper “Preparation for Improvisation with Oud and Interactive Electronics.”
				- The instrument is the [[Instrument/oud]] / العود, the fretless short-necked Arabic [[Instrument/lute]]
					- #Etymology of “lute”
						- (with the misunderstood definite article “al” / ال from “al oud” / “the oud” giving us the “L” in “lute”)
						- tonal material and phrase organization draws from the Arabic maqam / مقام system.
						- This piece premiered April 20, 2024 and is dedicated to all Arabs and all those who recognize their humanity.
