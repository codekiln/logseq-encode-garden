# [Smarter AI with GraphRAG – Connecting Structured & Unstructured Data for Better Retrieval](https://www.ai.engineer/summit/2025/schedule/smarter-ai-with-graphrag-connecting-structured-and-unstructured-data-for-better-retrieval)

- Generative AI is only as good as the data it retrieves—but traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is limited by flat, disconnected search. AI models struggle to connect structured data (databases, APIs) with unstructured data (docs, PDFs, chat logs), leading to incomplete answers and hallucinations.
- Enter GraphRAG—a next-generation retrieval approach powered by Neo4j. This workshop will show you how graphs unlock deeper context, better reasoning, and enterprise-ready AI applications. No graph experience needed!
- You’ll learn how to:
- Integrate structured and unstructured data into a unified retrieval system.
  Use GraphRAG to improve accuracy, explainability, and trust in AI-generated answers.
  Leverage graph-native retrieval, embeddings, and hybrid search for better responses.
  Apply GraphRAG to real-world use cases, from enterprise AI copilots to knowledge-driven automation.
  Whether you’re building AI-powered search, chatbots, or intelligent assistants—GraphRAG makes AI retrieval smarter. Join us to learn how Neo4j can take your Generative AI applications to the next level.
