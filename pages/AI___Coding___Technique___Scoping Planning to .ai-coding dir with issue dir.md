## Directory Structure
	- `/.ai-coding/TICKET-feature-name/`
		- Contains all planning and documentation assets for a single feature implementation
		- Named after the ticket and a brief description of the feature
- ## Core Planning Assets (see also [[Person/Harper Reed/Blog/25/02/My LLM codegen workflow atm]])
	- **Specification (**`TICKET-spec.mdc`)
		- Detailed technical requirements
		- Data model definitions
		- Acceptance criteria
		- Architecture decisions
	- **Prompt Plan (**`TICKET-prompt-plan.mdc`)
		- Step-by-step guide for AI implementation
		- Each prompt is incremental and builds on previous work
		- Includes validation steps after each prompt
		- Enforces commit discipline
	- **Todo List (**`TICKET-todo.md`)
		- Granular checklist of all required tasks
		- Organized by implementation phase
		- Tracks progress with checkboxes
		- Links back to spec and prompt plan
	- **Handoff Document (**`TICKET-handoff.md`)
		- Summary of all changes implemented
		- Testing results and verification steps
		- Documentation updates
		- Next steps for reviewers

	- `TICKET-jira-issue.md`: Original ticket details
	- `repomix.config.json`: Configuration for tooling [repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) for use with `o3-mini-high` in [HBS Enterprise ChatGPT](https://hbso.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GENAI/pages/416874520)
- ## Integration with IDE
	- Symlinks in `.cursor/rules/` during active development
	- Removed when feature is complete
- ## Key Benefits
	- Clear separation of planning from implementation
	- Structured approach to AI pair programming
	- Traceable progress through todo list
	- Comprehensive documentation for review
	- This structure provides a repeatable pattern for managing AI-assisted development while maintaining clear documentation and progress tracking.
