	- ## #Example of [[Markdown/Footnote]] in #Logseq
		- Footnotes are possible in logseq [^1]
		- Unfortunately, there's a bug that prevents logseq from parsing markdown-style link at the bottom of the document, but you can put in the url and it works. [^2]
	- ## [Footnotes | Logseq Tips & Tricks](https://unofficial-logseq-docs.gitbook.io/unofficial-logseq-docs/beginner-to-advance-features/footnotes)
		- You can add additional information to your text by using **Footnotes**.
		  The footnote text may appear appear
			- on the same block as the footnote (could be on a new line)
			- in a block below on the same level (*sibling*)
			- in a block below indented further (*child*)
			- in an unrelated block
		- ### How to Use Footnotes
			- To use footnotes, you add the footnote indicator (`[^1]`) at the end of your text. Further down the page, you add the footnote text for the marker (in this case, marker #1). For example:
			- `This is a line of text notice how I add the footnote marker at the end [^1]. Ok great and now?`
			- Where you want the footnote to appear, add:
			- `[^1]: This is the footnote to the text above`
			- Clicking on superscript 1 in the original text will navigate to the footnote. Clicking on the footnote will navigate back to the source text.
