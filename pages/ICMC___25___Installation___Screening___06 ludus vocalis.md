		- 21:41 extremely fast, scattered chunks of videos and audio recordings of various sounds that come from the mouth. Germs, Laughs.
		- It's very effervescent. Almost hard to take in, like pop rocks in soda inside the nose while going down a waterslide.
		- the [[Sound/Speaker/Multichannel]] [[Sound/Spatial]] explosion is gross and delightful. Any kid would love this. At the same time, it's not trying to shock in such a way that wouldn't be appropriate for a child.
		- There is an orgamic one, FYI parents ... but it's not graphic. It's kind of "fireworksy" and "auto-Tuney" - it's hard not to smile. The graphics here are not as literal as some. many times, it's graphical in a geometric way.
		- The contrast between the different sections in terms of sonority, visual appearance, texture, etc. it's very #Creative and well-done.
	- ## #Description
		- ludus vocalis (2024)
		- 25min work for [[Sound/Speaker/Multichannel/8 Channel]] audio,  [[Video/4k]]
		- explores, reimagines ==paralinguistic== vocal sounds as musical objects
			- **laughing**
			- **crying**
			- **screaming**
			- **gasping**
			- **moaning**
		- ... sounds carry emotional and largely cross-cultural qualities
			- **sixteen short vignettes**
			- each **focusing on a specific type of nonverbal vocalization**
		- ### Source Material
			- **manually** curated and gathered from **various online platforms**
				- [[Sound/Epidemic]] (https://www.epidemicsound.com/)
				- [[Splice]] (https://splice.com/)
				- [[FreeSound]] (https://freesound.org/)
		- samples—**586 audio files in WAV format**
			- (~40min)
			- organized into distinct **paralinguistic categories**
				- smaller, focused audio corpora created
			- Each corpus employed **different segmentation strategies**
				- and audio analyses
				- to facilitate deeper exploration of the source material.
		- ### Video
			- developed using AI-generated video, primarily created via [[AI/Text/To/Video]] **text-prompts** with [[RunwayML]] (https://runwayml.com/), as raw material.
			- **Broadly speaking**
				- generated videos were **intended to represent mouths enacting the different kinds of vocalizations** that **each movement was based on**
				- and the “failure” of the generative model to adhere to certain prompts was often embraced.
