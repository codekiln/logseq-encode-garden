# [Time navigation abstraction levels - The Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/time_management_abstraction_levels/)
	- > To be able to manage the complexity of the life roadmap we can use models for different levels of abstraction with different purposes. In **increasing** level of abstraction:

	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- [[2025-05-11 Sun]]
			- presents a set of templates for how to map tasks at these time levels into an [[Orgmode]] system
			- Similar to [[Person/Tiago Forte/PARA]]'s  separation between projects and areas, but puts **Areas** as the parent of **Projects**
