- # [Andrej Karpathy warns Programmers : I've never felt this much behind as a programmer](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/andrej-karpathy-warns-programmers-ive-never-felt-this-much-behind-as-a-programmer-18e67b6ad5ec)
	- Written by [[Person/Mehul Gupta]] for Data Science in Your Pocket
	- Discusses [[Person/Andrej Karpathy]]'s perspective on the rapidly evolving programming landscape
- ## Key Points
	- ### Shift in Software Development
		- Traditional approach of writing every line of code is being replaced by assembling and integrating existing tools and models
		- Programmers must adapt to new methodologies focused on orchestration rather than detailed implementation
	- ### New Programmable Layer
		- [[Person/Andrej Karpathy]] highlights a new abstraction layer involving:
			- Prompts
			- Tools
			- Memory
			- Agents
		- Programmers now focus on managing behavior and orchestrating these components rather than writing detailed logic
	- ### Probabilistic Systems
		- Unlike traditional deterministic programs, AI systems can produce varying outputs for the same input
		- Requires a shift in mindset from ensuring absolute correctness to:
			- Evaluating adequacy
			- Managing uncertainties
			- Testing behavior rather than just code
	- ### Enhanced Productivity
		- By effectively leveraging AI tools and understanding this new abstraction layer, developers can significantly boost their productivity
		- [[Person/Andrej Karpathy]] suggests that mastering these tools can make developers "10× more powerful"
	- ### Evolving Engineering Skills
		- While foundational engineering principles remain essential, new skills are becoming increasingly important:
			- Prompt engineering
			- Behavior testing
			- Guiding AI systems
			- System integration
			- Managing intelligent workflows
- ## Implications
	- This blog post underscores the importance of continuous learning and adaptation for programmers to stay relevant in the rapidly changing tech landscape
	- The transformation presents an opportunity for beginners to become more productive by mastering the art of effectively utilizing advanced tools
	- Embracing this change and experimenting with these tools is crucial for staying relevant in the field
