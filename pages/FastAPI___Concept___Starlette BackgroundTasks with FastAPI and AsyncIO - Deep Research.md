		- ## Overview of FastAPI Background Tasks
			- FastAPI leverages Starlette's in-process background task system to run operations after sending an HTTP response. A **background task** is a function (sync or async) attached to a response that executes **only once the response has been sent to the client** ([Background Tasks - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/background/#:~:text=Starlette%20includes%20a%20,process%20background%20tasks)). FastAPI provides a `BackgroundTasks` utility (built on Starlette's `BackgroundTask`) to collect multiple tasks during request processing and ensure they run post-response ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]). This allows you to offload non-critical work (e.g. sending emails, writing logs) so it doesn't block the main request/response cycle ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]).
		- ## Multiple BackgroundTasks in a Single Request
			- It's possible to schedule **multiple background tasks** in one API endpoint (e.g. via `background_tasks.add_task(...)` calls). These tasks will be executed **in the order they were added** ([Background Tasks - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/background/#:~:text=The%20tasks%20are%20executed%20in,the%20opportunity%20to%20be%20executed)). Key behaviors for multiple tasks in one request include:
			- **Sequential Execution:** Tasks run one after the other, in the sequence they were scheduled ([Background Tasks - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/background/#:~:text=The%20tasks%20are%20executed%20in,the%20opportunity%20to%20be%20executed)). They do not all start at once.
			- **Post-Response Start:** All background tasks begin only after the FastAPI endpoint has returned its response to the client ([Background Tasks - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/background/#:~:text=Starlette%20includes%20a%20,process%20background%20tasks)). The HTTP response is sent immediately once ready, and tasks execute asynchronously thereafter.
			- **Failure Handling:** If one background task raises an exception, any remaining tasks for that same request **will not be run** ([Background Tasks - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/background/#:~:text=The%20tasks%20are%20executed%20in,the%20opportunity%20to%20be%20executed)). In other words, a failure stops the chain of tasks attached to that response. (The response has already been delivered, so the client is not notified of this failure.)
			- **No Client Notification:** Since the tasks occur after the response, you cannot send an error back to the client from within a background task. An exception in a background task won't alter the HTTP response that was already sent ([python - FastAPI/Starlette: How to handle exceptions inside background tasks? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75146315/78202#:~:text=Background%20tasks%2C%20as%20the%20name,For%20example)).
			- For example, if you add three tasks in a single request and the second task crashes, the third task is skipped ([Background Tasks - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/background/#:~:text=The%20tasks%20are%20executed%20in,the%20opportunity%20to%20be%20executed)). Any exception is confined to the server logs/console; the client still sees a successful response in this scenario (unless you handle the exception and compensate in some way on the server).
		- ## Background Tasks Across Multiple Requests
			- Each incoming HTTP request gets its **own** `BackgroundTasks` instance to accumulate tasks ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]). Background tasks scheduled by different requests are **isolated and independent**:
			- **Per-Request Isolation:** Tasks from Request A have no knowledge of tasks from Request B. They run in the context of their own request's response handling.
			- **Failure Containment:** If a background task in Request A fails (raises an error), it **does not affect** the background tasks of Request B ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]). One request's tasks failing will not cancel or stop tasks triggered by other requests.
			- **Concurrent Execution:** Tasks from separate requests may execute in parallel (concurrently) on the server, depending on the server's throughput and event loop scheduling. For instance, if two requests arrive, each with background tasks, the tasks for both can run interleaved on the event loop or in threads after both responses are sent. They don't block each other beyond normal resource competition.
			- In a production scenario with Uvicorn, if you run multiple worker processes (using the `--workers` option), each worker process handles its own requests and background tasks. There is no shared state between workers – each process has its own event loop and thread pool ([[StackOverflow/22/03/FastAPI runs API calls in serial instead of parallel fashion]]). This means global variables or in-memory data won't be shared across requests handled by different workers ([[StackOverflow/22/03/FastAPI runs API calls in serial instead of parallel fashion]]), and a task failure in one worker process won't impact tasks running in another.
		- ## How BackgroundTasks Work Under the Hood (AsyncIO Integration)
			- **Starlette's `BackgroundTask` and `BackgroundTasks` classes** provide the mechanism for scheduling these post-response functions. Internally, Starlette attaches the background tasks to the response and, after sending out the response, calls them within the async event loop. Here's how it maps onto Python's asyncio and threading constructs:
			- **In-Process, Same Event Loop:** Background tasks run **in the same process and event loop** as the FastAPI application code ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]). They are not separate services or workers (unlike Celery tasks). This means they have access to the same memory and variables as the rest of your app (e.g. database connections or global states).
			- **Async Functions:** If a background task is an `async def` function, Starlette simply **awaits** it on the event loop when executing the task ([Thread Pool - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/threadpool/#:~:text=When%20you%27re%20using%20,also%20for%20internal%20Starlette%20code)). It behaves like any other awaited coroutine, allowing other tasks on the loop to interleave if awaiting I/O.
			- **Sync Functions (Thread Pool)**: If the task is a regular `def` function, Starlette will **run it in a thread pool** to avoid blocking the event loop ([Thread Pool - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/threadpool/#:~:text=When%20you%27re%20using%20,also%20for%20internal%20Starlette%20code)). In fact, Starlette uses `anyio.to_thread.run_sync` (which utilizes an asyncio thread pool executor) to execute sync background tasks off the main thread ([Thread Pool - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/threadpool/#:~:text=When%20you%27re%20using%20,also%20for%20internal%20Starlette%20code)). This means CPU-bound or blocking I/O in a sync task won't freeze the async loop – the loop schedules it on a worker thread and continues handling other asynchronous tasks. By default, the thread pool for such tasks is limited (e.g. 40 threads) to prevent unlimited threads ([Thread Pool - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/threadpool/#:~:text=Limitation)).
			- **Order of Execution:** Starlette's `BackgroundTasks` (the plural) simply holds a list of tasks and, when called, runs each one sequentially with `await`. The event loop will await each task (or threadpool future) to finish before moving to the next. This enforces the order guarantee mentioned earlier.
			- **FastAPI Integration:** FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` class is essentially a thin wrapper around Starlette's system. FastAPI imports and uses Starlette's implementation directly ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]). The main difference is that FastAPI allows you to declare a `background_tasks: BackgroundTasks` parameter in your path operation function (or dependency), and FastAPI will create and manage the `BackgroundTasks` object for you ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]). All tasks added (even in dependencies or sub-dependencies) are collected into one list and attached to the outgoing response automatically ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]). This saves you from manually attaching the tasks to a `Response` object – FastAPI handles that lifecycle behind the scenes.
			- In development (e.g. using Uvicorn with reload, or running under PyCharm/VSCode debugger), this mechanism remains the same. One thing to note during debugging: because sync tasks run in a separate thread, you might need to ensure your debugger is configured to stop on exceptions in **all threads**. If you set a breakpoint inside a background task function, it will hit when that task executes (which is after the response). Otherwise, an unhandled exception in a background thread might just print to the console. In single-process debug mode, all tasks run on the one event loop (plus threads for any sync tasks), so you can step through them as normal once they start.
		- ## Exception Handling and Logging in Background Tasks
			- Handling errors in background tasks requires a different approach than in the request/response cycle. By the time a background task runs, the client has already received a response, so you cannot send back an error or use FastAPI's exception handlers in the usual way ([python - FastAPI/Starlette: How to handle exceptions inside background tasks? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75146315/78202#:~:text=Background%20tasks%2C%20as%20the%20name,For%20example)). Important points and best practices include:
			- **Uncaught Exceptions are Not Propagated to Clients:** If a background task raises an exception, that exception will not affect the HTTP response (which is already delivered) ([python - FastAPI/Starlette: How to handle exceptions inside background tasks? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75146315/78202#:~:text=Background%20tasks%2C%20as%20the%20name,For%20example)). FastAPI/Starlette won't send any error payload to the client for such failures. Instead, the exception will surface in the server's logs or console. Starlette stops executing subsequent tasks for that request on the first exception, as noted earlier ([Background Tasks - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/background/#:~:text=The%20tasks%20are%20executed%20in,the%20opportunity%20to%20be%20executed)).
			- **Global Exception Handlers Don't Catch Task Errors:** FastAPI's global exception handlers or middleware (which handle errors during request processing) do **not** automatically catch exceptions in background tasks, since those occur after the response cycle. For example, adding an `@app.exception_handler(Exception)` or using Starlette's ExceptionMiddleware won't intercept background task errors. They run outside the normal request context, so you must handle them explicitly.
			- **Use Try/Except in the Task:** The recommended way to handle errors is to wrap the background task logic in a `try...except` block. This way, you can catch any exception and decide how to handle it (log it, suppress it, etc.) ([python - FastAPI/Starlette: How to handle exceptions inside background tasks? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75146315/78202#:~:text=def%20test_func%28a%2C%20b%29%3A%20try%3A%20,print%20out%20the%20Exception%27s%20details)). For example:
				- ~~~python
				  def background_job():
				    try:
				        # ... do work ...
				    except Exception as e:
				        logger.error(f"Background task failed: {e}")
				  ~~~
			- By catching exceptions inside the task, you prevent them from propagating upward and causing an "unhandled exception" in the server. The Stack Overflow community specifically suggests this approach for FastAPI/Starlette background tasks ([python - FastAPI/Starlette: How to handle exceptions inside background tasks? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75146315/78202#:~:text=def%20test_func%28a%2C%20b%29%3A%20try%3A%20,print%20out%20the%20Exception%27s%20details)).
			- **Logging and Monitoring:** Instead of just printing errors, use the Python `logging` module or an observability tool to record exceptions in background tasks ([python - FastAPI/Starlette: How to handle exceptions inside background tasks? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75146315/78202#:~:text=If%20you%20would%20like%20to,here%20%20and%20%2059)). For instance, log the stack trace or error message in the `except` block so you have a record. This is important for production diagnosis, since you won't have a client-facing error. You can also integrate error monitoring systems (like Sentry or similar) to capture exceptions occurring in background tasks. These tools often hook into logging or `sys.excepthook` to catch uncaught exceptions. Make sure your logging is configured to flush before the application exits, especially if tasks run right before shutdown.
			- **Diagnostics in Development:** During development, you can catch errors by observing the console output or using a debugger. If you're running under PyCharm/VSCode, you can set breakpoints in the background task code. When the task executes, the breakpoint will trigger, allowing you to inspect variables. Also consider enabling "break on exception" in your IDE for all exceptions – this can pause execution at the point of failure in a background task. Keep in mind that if the background task is running in a thread (for sync functions), the debugger needs to be aware of child threads. After handling, ensure the exception is logged or handled so it doesn't just disappear.
			- In summary, **the onus is on the developer to handle background task errors**. The official FastAPI documentation and experts recommend catching exceptions inside the task and logging or handling them, since the framework will not automatically intervene ([python - FastAPI/Starlette: How to handle exceptions inside background tasks? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75146315/78202#:~:text=Background%20tasks%2C%20as%20the%20name,For%20example)) ([python - FastAPI/Starlette: How to handle exceptions inside background tasks? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75146315/78202#:~:text=If%20you%20would%20like%20to,here%20%20and%20%2059)). By doing so, you can prevent silent failures and gather information about issues happening in the background.
		- ## Choosing BackgroundTasks vs. AsyncIO Primitives or Other Solutions
			- FastAPI's built-in BackgroundTasks are convenient for certain use cases, but they aren't the only way to handle asynchronous or background work. Depending on the scenario, you might choose a different approach:
			- **Use FastAPI's BackgroundTasks when** you have relatively quick, lightweight tasks that need to run after a request, especially if those tasks need access to the FastAPI app's context (e.g. database session, cache, or other in-memory data). They are ideal for tasks like sending an email notification, writing to a log or database, or calling a third-party API in the background, as long as these tasks are not too resource-intensive ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]). BackgroundTasks shine for simplicity – you get integration with FastAPI's dependency injection (so you can inject `BackgroundTasks` into any dependency or endpoint) and the framework handles scheduling the tasks at the right time ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]).
			- **Using `asyncio.create_task` (or other asyncio primitives):** If you are inside an `async def` endpoint, you could manually schedule a coroutine to run in the background using `asyncio.create_task(some_coro())`. This achieves a similar effect to BackgroundTasks for async functions – it spawns the coroutine to run concurrently. However, there are caveats:
				- You must ensure to handle exceptions from that task (for example, by wrapping it or adding a done-callback), otherwise an unhandled exception in a created task will be logged as an error by the event loop.
				- The task will start running immediately (concurrently with the rest of your endpoint code). If you call `create_task` at the end of your endpoint function, effectively the background work starts around the same time the response is being sent. FastAPI's BackgroundTasks, by contrast, schedules execution strictly after the response. In practice, this difference is small, but it can matter if your background work should definitely not overlap with response preparation.
				- `asyncio.create_task` is a lower-level primitive; use it when you need more control than BackgroundTasks provides. For example, if you want to launch a background coroutine that persists beyond the request scope or coordinate multiple background coroutines (using `asyncio.gather`, queues, etc.), you may need to manage them manually.
			- **Using an `asyncio.Queue` with a Worker:** For scenarios where you have many background jobs produced by requests and you want to regulate their execution (for instance, limit how many run at once or process them in order), an architecture with an in-memory queue can be useful. You can create an `asyncio.Queue` and have a dedicated **worker coroutine** (started at app startup) that pulls tasks from the queue and executes them one by one. Your request endpoints would `queue.put_nowait(job)` instead of using BackgroundTasks. This approach gives you more control (you can retry jobs, bulkhead isolate them, etc.), but it's more complex to implement. It also remains in-process; if the server restarts, queued jobs vanish unless you persist them.
			- **Offloading to Threads or Processes:** If the background work is CPU-bound or blocking and you want to parallelize it, you might consider running it outside the asyncio event loop entirely. Starlette already helps by using a threadpool for sync BackgroundTasks, but you might need more. For example, you can use `threading.Thread` to start a truly separate thread for a long task, or use `multiprocessing` to spawn a separate process. These approaches require careful management (joining threads, IPC for processes, etc.) and are usually not necessary for simple cases. They can be useful for heavy computations where you want to keep the AsyncIO event loop completely free. Keep in mind that using these within a Uvicorn worker still means if that process goes down, the work is lost.
			- **Using Celery or external task queues:** For **heavy, long-running, or distributed tasks**, the official recommendation is to use a separate task queue system like **Celery** (possibly with Redis/RabbitMQ) or similar tools ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]) ([[StackOverflow/22/03/FastAPI runs API calls in serial instead of parallel fashion]]). Celery allows running tasks outside the web server process, possibly on multiple worker nodes, and can manage retries, scheduling, etc. This is appropriate if you need the task to persist independently of the web request process or run on a schedule or across a cluster. FastAPI's creator notes that for tasks needing to run across multiple processes or servers (or that need a robust retry mechanism), an external solution is more suitable ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]). Use BackgroundTasks for the lightweight stuff, and Celery (or RQ, Huey, etc.) for the heavy lifting.
			- **Scheduled Jobs (APScheduler or others):** If your need is to run tasks at certain times or intervals (not directly triggered by a single request), you might integrate a scheduler like APScheduler. This can live in the same app process and schedule functions to run, but again, for reliability consider an external scheduler or ensure the server is always running.
			- In essence, **FastAPI's BackgroundTasks are a pragmatic choice for fire-and-forget tasks tied to web requests**. They are easy to use and require no additional infrastructure. However, they run within the Uvicorn server process. If that process is stopped or restarted (e.g. during development reloads or server crashes), any pending background tasks stop too. For critical tasks that must complete or for workloads that might overwhelm the server, a more robust background processing system is warranted.
			- Finally, note that running multiple Uvicorn workers (processes) is also a way to scale CPU-bound tasks – each process can execute tasks in parallel on a different core ([[StackOverflow/22/03/FastAPI runs API calls in serial instead of parallel fashion]]). But remember, each worker will have its own separate queue of BackgroundTasks. If you have shared resources (like a file or an in-memory queue), you'll need external synchronization (or better, use a shared service like a database or Redis). Typically, if you find yourself needing cross-worker coordination or processing jobs later/independently, it's a sign to use an external task queue instead of in-process background tasks.
		- ## Conclusion
			- **FastAPI's background task system (via Starlette) provides a simple way to perform asynchronous work after sending a response**, without blocking the client. Multiple tasks run sequentially per request and won't interfere with each other or with tasks from other requests ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]) ([Background Tasks - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/background/#:~:text=The%20tasks%20are%20executed%20in,the%20opportunity%20to%20be%20executed)). Under the hood, these tasks run on the asyncio event loop (with threadpool help for sync functions) within the Uvicorn worker process ([Thread Pool - Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/threadpool/#:~:text=When%20you%27re%20using%20,also%20for%20internal%20Starlette%20code)). This design makes them lightweight and easy to use, but also means you are responsible for handling errors (using try/except and logging inside the task) and understanding their limitations in production. By following best practices – catching exceptions in tasks, logging appropriately, and choosing the right tool for the job (simple background tasks vs. asyncio `create_task` vs. Celery, etc.) – you can reliably integrate background processing into your FastAPI application ([python - FastAPI/Starlette: How to handle exceptions inside background tasks? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75146315/78202#:~:text=def%20test_func%28a%2C%20b%29%3A%20try%3A%20,print%20out%20the%20Exception%27s%20details)) ([[StackOverflow/22/03/FastAPI runs API calls in serial instead of parallel fashion]]). The official docs and community advice align on this: use background tasks for the quick stuff that benefits from being in-process, and switch to more robust solutions when your background processing needs grow beyond that ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]) ([[FastAPI/Docs/Tutorial/Background Tasks]]). With this understanding, you can develop and debug your FastAPI app (in PyCharm/VSCode or otherwise) knowing exactly how and when those background tasks are executed, and ensure they behave consistently in development and production environments.
