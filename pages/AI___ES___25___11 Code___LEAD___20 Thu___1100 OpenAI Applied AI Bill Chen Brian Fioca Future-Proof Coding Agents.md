	- ## Talk: Future-Proof Coding Agents: Building Reliable Systems That Outlast Model Cycles [02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMSprbJ95jg&t=7898s) - OpenAI Team (Bill Chen & Brian Fioca) Presentation Starts
		- Coding agents are becoming one of the most active areas in applied AI, yet many teams keep rebuilding fragile infrastructure every time models or providers change. We believe there is a better way. By anchoring on a stable abstraction layer like Codex, we can stop worrying about harness rewrites and focus on the parts of the stack that create lasting value. We treat models as interchangeable sub-agents, plug into shared primitives, and let upstream improvements flow through without breaking products. This lets teams move faster, stay resilient as the ecosystem evolves, and focus their energy on domain-specific workflows and user experience.
	- ## Agenda
		- Coding agents
		- Coding agent harnesses
		- Codex as both model + harness
		- Agents and sub-agents
		- Future of Codex
	- ## Coding Agents: Core Components
	- **User Interface** (left column; speech-bubble icon)
		- CLI
		- IDE (e.g., VS Code)
		- Cloud / background agent
	- **Models** (center column; robot icon)
		- GPT-5.1
		- GPT-5.1 Codex Max
		- Claude Opus / Sonnet / Haiku
		- Composer, SWE 1.5, Gemini, Grok
	- **Harness** (right column; cluster icon)
		- Open / closed source
		- Prompts
		- Agentic loop
		- Tools + descriptions: Semantic search, Websearch, Patch/Edit, Browser
	- ## Coding Agents: Active Frontier
	- Dozens of teams build their own harnesses + prompts
	- Tools are diverse/opinionated: search, context-gathering, edits, progress-tracking
	- Models keep changing: different strengths, habits, API shapes
	- **Problem:** every model revision forces teams to adapt harnesses + tools
	- ## Building + maintaining a harness
	- **DIY challenges:** custom tools out-of-distribution; prompt engineering to fit model; poor prompt portability
	- **New model challenges:** latency; context-window strategy; API response + tool-call format changes
	- ## Steerability = intelligence + habit
	- **Training side-effects:** steerable vs baked-in behavior; tool-priming quirks; RL-shaped habits
	- **Prompts aren’t interchangeable:** cloning Claude prompts to GPT-5 hurts latency/reasoning; harness-level steering beats prompt microtuning
- ## 03 Codex as a model and a harness
	- Codex: many built-in tools
		- Parallel tools + shell cmds: `run_terminal_cmd`, `apply_patch`, `search`
		- Security + sandboxing: permissions, ports
		- Context compaction: prompting, triggers, re-injection, cache tuning
		- MCP support: context + security
		- Images/screenshots: processing, resizing
		- Model is tuned tightly to this harness (and “way harder than you think”).
	- Codex bundles capabilities
		- Writes + executes code and terminal commands
		- Therefore: a **computer-use agent** for the terminal
		- If your task is expressible as file ops + CLI ops, just use Codex
	- If your task is expressible as file ops + CLI ops, use Codex
		- Even if it doesn’t feel like a coding task
		- If it can be done by running tools from the command line, use Codex
	- Assign agents to your agents
		- Harness = new abstraction layer
		- Treat Codex as a **pluggable agent inside your agent**
		- Benefits: stability (swap models safely); prompt decoupling; automatic upgrades
		- Result: durable platform that rides the wave, not drowned by it
	- Sub-agent patterns
		- **01 — Codex SDK**
			- TS library; programmatic `exec`; GitHub Action integration
		- **02 — Agents SDK + MCP**
			- Expose Codex as an MCP tool; give it MCP hooks back into your API
		- **03 — [[Zed]] ACP**
			- Instead of IDE-specific harnesses, wrap Codex and let UI/UX pass through
	- Direct Codex integration (harness + model)
		- Codex SDK supports: CI/CD control; embedding Codex in your app; building agents that talk to Codex directly
	- Or directly with the model
		- **Tweet example (Jediah Katz, Oct 30):** [[CursorAI]] 2.0 agent-harness improvements boosted GPT-5 Codex quality; runs longer uninterrupted; less overthinking; more accurate edits
		- **How to do it:**
			- Check the prompting guide — primary resource for shaping Codex behavior
			- Customize only after baselining — reach parity with first-party harness before adding features
			- Align with the open-source harness — Codex CLI ships open-sourced prompt + tools for consistency
