- A **Layer 1 protocol** refers to the **base-level blockchain architecture** — the foundational layer upon which everything else is built. It handles core functions like:
- **Consensus** (how nodes agree on the state of the network)
- **Data availability** (who stores what)
- **Transaction execution** (who does the computation)
  
  Examples:
- **Ethereum**
- **Bitcoin**
- **Solana**
- **Avalanche**
  
  When people say “Layer 1,” they mean the **primary chain** itself — not the apps on top, and not scaling solutions. By contrast:
- **Layer 2 protocols** (like Optimism or Arbitrum) are **built on top** of Layer 1s to improve speed, reduce cost, etc.
- **Apps/dapps** run above Layer 1 and Layer 2.
  
  In the agent context, if someone says “we’re building a Layer 1 for agents,” they probably mean:
  
  > “We’re creating a foundational decentralized protocol where agent communication, coordination, and transactions happen natively — not as an app on Ethereum, but as its own network.”
