- ## Notes on Instructions
	- > For example, to add a package with `yarn` you can Cmd-J from inside of VSCode and run the command. If you add a package, then the `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files are also updated, which you can then check to source control.
		- DONE what is Cmd+J in [[VSCode]]? It looks like it's `View: Toggle Panel Visibility` for me:
			- [[VSCode/Keymap]]
				- ```json
				  {
				    "key": "cmd+j",
				    "command": "workbench.action.togglePanel"
				  }
				  ```
