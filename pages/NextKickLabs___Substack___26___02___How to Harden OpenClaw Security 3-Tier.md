	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- This is a practical hardening playbook that starts with Docker hygiene, then host protection, then enterprise controls.
		- The framing is explicitly incremental: teams can stop at Tier 1 for local/lab use, add Tier 2 for internet-exposed/self-hosted environments, and apply Tier 3 for regulated or enterprise deployments.
		- The guide also includes concrete architecture patterns and a phased rollout roadmap, not just control checklists.
	- ## Tier overview
		- **Tier 1 (Container-level hardening):** lock down runtime privileges, image quality, network boundaries, secrets, and basic visibility.
		- **Tier 2 (Host-level hardening):** secure the VM/host OS with SSH hardening, firewalling, patching, intrusion prevention, auditing, and backup/recovery.
		- **Tier 3 (Enterprise controls):** formalize identity, segmentation, centralized secrets, continuous monitoring, compliance mapping, and incident response.
	- ## Tier 1 details (container hardening)
		- Run containers as non-root with least privilege (`cap_drop: ALL`, `no-new-privileges`, read-only root FS where possible, bounded resources).
		- Build from minimal trusted base images and pin versions; avoid mutable `latest` tags.
		- Use network isolation and minimize exposed ports to reduce lateral movement risk.
		- Keep secrets out of image layers and repos; inject at runtime from environment/secret stores.
		- Enable structured logs and metrics early so failed auth, suspicious egress, and unusual process behavior are observable.
	- ## Tier 2 details (host hardening)
		- Harden SSH (key auth only, disable root/password login, non-default policies) and protect ingress with strict firewall defaults.
		- Keep the host patched continuously (automated security updates) and apply CIS-style baseline controls.
		- Add brute-force and abuse controls (`fail2ban`, rate limits) plus audit trails (`auditd`, system logs, file-integrity checks).
		- Back up critical config/state and rehearse restoration so hardening does not create recovery blind spots.
		- Validate isolation boundaries between OpenClaw services and other workloads on the same host.
	- ## Tier 3 details (enterprise/regulated)
		- Enforce RBAC and identity federation with least privilege for humans, services, and automation.
		- Introduce network segmentation and service-to-service trust controls (mTLS/service mesh patterns where needed).
		- Centralize secret management with rotation and access auditing (Vault/cloud secret managers).
		- Aggregate security telemetry into SIEM/EDR workflows with alert tuning and response playbooks.
		- Map controls to compliance objectives (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR/HIPAA as applicable) and run periodic control testing.
	- ## Key anti-patterns to avoid
		- Running privileged containers in production without explicit, reviewed necessity.
		- Exposing OpenClaw to `0.0.0.0` without gateway/WAF, auth controls, and network policy.
		- Using mutable image tags and ad-hoc manual patching as the default operating model.
		- Storing secrets in source code, Dockerfiles, or plaintext host files.
		- Treating security as one-time setup instead of continuous verification.
	- ## Suggested implementation sequence
		- Week 1: complete Tier 1 baseline controls and validate app functionality under restricted privileges.
		- Week 2: implement Tier 2 host controls, backup/restore tests, and log/audit collection.
		- Week 3+: prioritize Tier 3 controls based on actual risk/compliance requirements, not all-at-once complexity.
