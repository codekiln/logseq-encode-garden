- # How To Create a [Diataxis How-To Guide](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/)
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- This page is referenced by a [[CursorAI/Project Rule/diataxis-how-to.mdc]]
	- ## Overview
		- This guide walks you through creating an effective How-To guide following the Diataxis documentation framework.
		- It's for documentation writers, technical writers, and anyone who needs to create clear, actionable instructions.
	- ## Prerequisites
		- Basic understanding of the documentation purpose
		- Knowledge of the subject matter you're documenting
		- Clear idea of the specific task your guide will address
	- ## Steps
		- ### 1. Identify a Specific Task or Problem
			- Choose a concrete, practical goal that users need to accomplish
			- Make sure it's focused and specific (e.g., "How to reset your password" rather than "How to use accounts")
			- Verify that it addresses a real user need
		- ### 2. Create a Clear, Action-Oriented Title
			- Start with "How to" followed by a verb and the specific task
			- Examples:
				- "How to Configure Email Notifications"
				- "How to Export Data as CSV"
				- "How to Troubleshoot Connection Issues"
		- ### 3. Write a Brief Overview
			- Summarize what the guide helps accomplish in 1-2 sentences
			- Identify who the guide is for and when they might need it
			- Don't include conceptual explanations or background theory
		- ### 4. List Prerequisites
			- Specify what the reader needs before starting
			- Include required tools, permissions, knowledge, or resources
			- Be specific about versions or configurations if relevant
		- ### 5. Create Sequential, Numbered Steps
			- Break down the task into logical, ordered steps
			- Start each step with an action verb (Configure, Click, Enter, etc.)
			- Keep steps focused on a single action when possible
			- Include screenshots or examples for complex steps
			- Use conditional statements for steps with variations: "If X, then do Y"
		- ### 6. Add Troubleshooting Information
			- Anticipate common issues users might encounter
			- Provide clear solutions for each problem
			- Use a problem/solution format: "If you see [error], then [solution]"
		- ### 7. Include Related Resources
			- Link to related guides, reference material, or explanations
			- Don't include this information directly in your guide
			- Focus on connections that are immediately useful to someone performing this task
		- ### 8. Review and Test Your Guide
			- Follow your own instructions to verify they work
			- Check for missing steps or assumptions
			- Ensure the guide remains focused on the specific task
			- Remove any unnecessary explanations or digressions
	- ## Troubleshooting
		- If your guide becomes too long: Break it into multiple, more focused guides
		- If steps are unclear: Add more specific details or examples
		- If users report confusion: Check for missing prerequisites or assumptions
		- If the guide contains too much explanation: Move theoretical content to a separate explanation document and link to it
