- [EFLS/zetteldeft: A Zettelkasten system! Or rather, some functions on top of the emacs deft package.](https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft)
	- > **UPDATE 2023**: Zetteldeft is no longer in active development, as its main author is moving away from a note-taking system based on Deft towards one based on Denote. The Emacs package and this repository will remain available, but might no longer receive updates.
