	- A style of AI-native software delivery where humans design goals, specs, scenarios, and evaluation harnesses, while coding agents perform the implementation loops.
	- Core claim: humans should not manually write or line-review production code; instead, trust is built through scenario-based validation, holdout-style evaluation, and continuous empirical checks.
