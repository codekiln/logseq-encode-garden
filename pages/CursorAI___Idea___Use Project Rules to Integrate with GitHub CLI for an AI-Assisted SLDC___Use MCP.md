- This idea is an extension to [[CursorAI/Idea/Use Project Rules to Integrate with GitHub CLI for an AI-Assisted SLDC]] that considers whether it might make sense to use a [[Model Context Protocol]] to interact with the [[GitHub/API]] to provide the same context that flat files would in that project.
- An example of an MCP server is available in [[Person/Kevin Leneway/Github/awesome-cursor-mpc-server]]. In this case, there may be an existing server available that interacts with the GitHub API; see [[CursorAI/Sites/cursor.directory/mcp]] for a list of MCP servers. There is one for GitHub listed, but it's incorrectly linked to the Linear server at this time. The official list of MCP servers are at [[MCP/GitHub/servers]], and there's already one in [[MCP/GitHub/servers/GitHub]]
