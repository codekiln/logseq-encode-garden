		- A Learning Experience Platform (LXP) is a modern learning management system designed to offer a more personalized and engaging learning experience for users. Unlike traditional LMS platforms that focus primarily on delivering structured training content, LXPs prioritize the learner's experience by providing a curated and dynamic learning environment. One of the key features of an LXP is its ability to combine learning content from various sources, including internal digital assets, external third-party material, and even user-generated content. This diverse range of content ensures that learners have access to a wide array of resources to support their learning goals.
