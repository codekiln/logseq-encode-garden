# [Building a Personal AI Factory (July 2025 snapshot)](https://www.john-rush.com/posts/ai-20250701.html) with [[Claude Code]]
	- [[My Notes]]
		- uses [[git/worktree]]
		- uses [[o3]] for planning and [[Anthropic/Model/Claude/4.0/Sonnet]]
			- > o3 checks the results against the original ask
		- uses [[Goose]]
			- > Goose only because Iâ€™ve already got it setup to use the models hosted in our Azure OpenAI subscription. Looking to improve this at some point, but it works for now.
