- # Ars Suita 10min
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- A starscape; reminds me of an [[Orrey]].
		- At times, reminds me of [[Person/George Rhoads]] [[Audiokinetic Sound Sculpture]]
		- It's an [[Sound/Speaker/Multichannel/8 Channel]] composition (I can see the UI)
		- So it's a form of recomposition
	- ## Description
		- **Ars Suita** (the art of the suite) is an acousmatic work that revisits the panegyric trio suite “Concert instrumental sous le titre d`Apothéose de Monsieur de Lully”, composed by [[Person/Francois Couperin]] (1668-1733) and published in Paris in 1735. This suite serves as an homage to the French composer [[Person/Jean-Baptiste Lully]], who was one of the most important composers of the French Baroque era. As the music director of the royal court of France, Lully’s compositions had a significant impact on French musical style. Couperin’s “Apotheosis” is a suite of pieces that includes a prelude, several dances, and a final chaconne. The suite showcases Couperin’s skill in composing for a variety of instrumental combinations, including strings, winds, and continuo. Its graceful melodies, refined harmonies, and intricate counterpoint are all characteristic of the French Baroque style.
			- Ars Suita is structured in nine movements that follow the same structure as the original piece by Couperin. The material for each of the movements is derived from an audio recording of the original “Apotheosis” with early music instruments. Each movement uses a different sound processing technique, creating a particular sonic character for each part of this acousmatic suite.
			- Like many Baroque composers, Couperin paid tribute to his predecessors and contemporaries through his music. In the same spirit, Ars Suita is a small homage to Couperin, and indirectly to Lully. Composed in a home studio and mastered at CITALAB, Department of Electrical Engineering, Campus San Joaquín, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.
