# DB Version vs Markdown Version (from [[Logseq/DB/FAQ/Unofficial]])
	- ## Similarities
		- Both versions support hierarchical, block-based note-taking with nested bullet points
		- Both utilize [[Markdown]] for formatting (bold, italics, headings, etc.)
		- Both support core Logseq features:
			- Bi-directional linking with `[[wikilinks]]`
			- Graph visualization
			- Tags with `#tag` syntax
			- Block references with `((...))` syntax
			- Property blocks and queries
		- Both maintain the same user interface and editing experience
		- Both support Logseq Flavored Markdown (LFM) syntax
	- ## Differences
		- ### Storage Mechanism
			- **Markdown Version:**
				- Stores notes as individual `.md` files in the filesystem
				- Files are the authoritative source of data
				- Can be directly edited with any text editor
				- Files stored in `pages/` and `journals/` directories
			- **DB Version:**
				- Stores notes in a centralized [[SQLite]] database file
				- Database is the primary source of truth
				- Notes can be exported to Markdown, but database remains authoritative
				- Direct editing of database outside Logseq is not supported
		- ### Git Compatibility
			- **Markdown Version:**
				- Fully compatible with Git version control
				- Git can handle merge conflicts in plain text files
				- Ideal for users who want to version control their notes with Git
			- **DB Version:**
				- Not compatible with Git version control
				- Git cannot handle merge conflicts in SQLite database files
				- Users wanting Git integration must use Markdown or Org mode
		- ### Data Portability
			- **Markdown Version:**
				- High portability - files can be accessed by any Markdown editor
				- Easy to migrate to other tools
				- Can be read and edited with standard text editors
				- Compatible with other Markdown-based applications
			- **DB Version:**
				- Lower portability - requires Logseq to access data
				- Can export to Markdown, but primary storage is proprietary
				- Limited interoperability with external tools
				- Database structure is not human-readable
		- ### Performance and Scalability
			- **Markdown Version:**
				- Performance can degrade with large numbers of files
				- Slower indexing and search times as collection grows
				- File system operations can become a bottleneck
			- **DB Version:**
				- Optimized for large datasets
				- Faster search and retrieval through database queries
				- Better indexing and performance with extensive note collections
				- Designed for scalability
		- ### Collaboration Features
			- **Markdown Version:**
				- Primarily single-user focused
				- Collaboration requires external tools (Git, cloud storage)
				- Manual file sharing and synchronization
			- **DB Version:**
				- Real-Time Collaboration (RTC) support
				- Multiple users can work simultaneously on the same graph
				- Immediate synchronization across users
				- Enhanced collaboration features (may require Logseq Pro subscription)
		- ### Open Source Status
			- **Markdown Version:**
				- Fully open source
				- Community can contribute and modify
			- **DB Version:**
				- Not open source
				- Proprietary implementation
		- ### Feature Compatibility
			- **Markdown Version:**
				- Some Logseq-specific features may not translate to other Markdown editors
				- Logseq syntax (`[[links]]`, `#tags`, `((block-refs))`) may not be recognized elsewhere
				- Broad compatibility with Markdown ecosystem
			- **DB Version:**
				- Full support for all Logseq advanced features
				- Enhanced query capabilities
				- Optimized for Logseq's complete feature set
				- Limited compatibility with external Markdown editors
		- ### NewTags Feature
			- **Markdown Version:**
				- NewTags feature not available
				- Tags are simple markers without associated properties
			- **DB Version:**
				- NewTags feature available - allows associating properties with tags
				- When a tag with properties is applied to a page, those properties are automatically assigned
				- Enables structured data entry and automatic property assignment
				- Example: Applying `#contact` tag with `phone::` and `email::` properties automatically assigns those properties to the page
				- Supports table views for tagged items with their associated properties

		- ### Use Case Recommendations
			- **Choose Markdown Version if:**
				- You prioritize data portability and flexibility
				- You want to use Git for version control
				- You need compatibility with other Markdown tools
				- You prefer open source solutions
				- You want direct file access and editing
			- **Choose DB Version if:**
				- You prioritize performance with large note collections
				- You need real-time collaboration features
				- You want enhanced synchronization across devices
				- You're building a large-scale knowledge base
				- You don't need Git integration
