# How do I get the mouse to not click in a quantized way when selecting a clip?
	- ## Context
		- You want to select a bit of a clip in [[Ableton/Arrangement View]] without obeying the groove
	- ## Steps
		- ### Method 1 - Set [[Ableton/Menu/Options/Snap/to Grid]] to off
			- you may also need to set [[Ableton/Menu/Options/Snap/to Grid/Automation]] to off, depending on whether automation is showing; [ableton docs](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209070629-Working-with-Automation-and-Modulation?)
		- ### Method 2 - Temporary - [[Ableton/Arrangement View/Clip/Select/Cmd Drag]] allows bypassing snap to grid
	- ## Citation
		- In Ableton Live’s Arrangement View, even when the grid is set to “None,” mouse actions may still snap to the grid. This behavior can be influenced by the “Snap Automation to Grid” setting. To ensure complete freedom from grid snapping:
			- Navigate to the **Options** menu.
			- Ensure that **“Snap Automation to Grid”** is **unchecked**.
		- This setting affects how automation breakpoints and other elements snap to the grid. Disabling it allows for more precise, freehand adjustments without unintended snapping.
		- Additionally, holding down the **Cmd (Mac)** or **Ctrl (Windows)** key while performing mouse actions can temporarily disable snapping, providing further control over placement.
