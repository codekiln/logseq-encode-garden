	- ## Story
		- The poem begins as an old [sorcerer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magician_(fantasy)) departs his workshop, leaving his apprentice with chores to perform. Tired of fetching water by pail, the apprentice [enchants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incantation) a [broom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom) to do the work for him, using [magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)) in which he is not fully trained. The floor is soon awash with water, and the apprentice realizes that he cannot stop the broom because he does not know the magic required to do so.
		- The apprentice splits the broom in two with an axe, but each piece becomes a whole broom that takes up a pail and continues fetching water, now at twice the speed. At this increased pace, the entire room quickly begins to flood. When all seems lost, the old sorcerer returns and quickly breaks the spell. The poem concludes with the old sorcerer's statement that only a master should invoke powerful spirits.
