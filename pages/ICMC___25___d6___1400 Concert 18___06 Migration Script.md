	- ## #Description
		- Migration Script centers on the unrelenting forces of nature that push creatures to live their lives as molded through centuries-old patterns without question. Using Mark Wheeler’s ‘Overwintering’ script and Zach Scholl’s ‘granchild’ script for the [[Monome/Norns]], the performer reacts to and shapes the slowly evolving harmonic content generated in real-time from bird migration patterns captured across Europe. Building new polyphonic and rhythmic overlays from bird song field recordings and the aforementioned sonified data, the performer uses granular engines and digital sample reduction processing to impart their fleeting influence on an unrelenting force. In this manner, the musician gains an improvisation partner out of one of their own instruments, a source of stochastic drive they must attempt to sculpt and decide how to react to in each performance.
