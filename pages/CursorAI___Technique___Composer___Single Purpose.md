  by creating new composers (cmd + n) you start fresh with a clean slate - no context pollution from other tasks. whenever i need to make different unrelated changes, i just create a new composer to keep each task isolated
- > i call them single purpose composers
- > you can always jump back to your previous composers through history [[CursorAI/Command/Show Composer History]] (cmd + option + L) if you find yourself needing to create a new composer in the middle of a task
