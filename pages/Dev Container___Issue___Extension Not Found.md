- [[GitHub/codekiln/dev-container-test]]
- [[VSCode/Extension/QuickStage]] not installed
- one of the reasons I created this test repo was to see if I could reproduce the issue I saw [[2025-02-08 Sat]] in [[Person/codekiln/GitHub/alits]] where QuickStage wasn't installed, even though I had it in my [[VSCode/Dev Container/.devcontainer.json]] file. Sure enough, this minimal test repo does reproduce it.

- I pushed up the repo to [codekiln/dev-container-test: testing a simple dev container](https://github.com/codekiln/dev-container-test/tree/main), now I'd like to contact the QuickStage plugin author, [[GitHub/Bluesteel-Software]]
	- I looked through [git-stage-file/extension.js at main · Bluesteel-Software/git-stage-file](https://github.com/Bluesteel-Software/git-stage-file/blob/main/extension.js) and it looks remarkably easy to create a [[VSCode/Extension]]; I'll have to do that sometime.
- Unrelated issues in VSCode (it's actually a cursor issue)

		- > What I observe ([@orolega](https://github.com/orolega) please confirm): When open a dev container, switch to a non-default profile and then rebuild that container with extensions listed in the devcontainer.json to be installed at server startup, I end up in the non-default profile without the extensions (that seems unexpected). If I then switch to the default profile, the extensions are there.
		- that sounds related to the behavior I'm observing

			- I’m having a really odd bug with the extensions marketplace. For my work I’m supposed to get the Dev-Containers extension, however, this never shows up (along with lots of other extensions). It’s like I have an entirely different marketplace then my coworkers (I’ve cleared filters and reinstalled Cursor already). I tested this out with Dev Containers specifically. The only way I was able to get the Dev Containers was by downloading it from the Microsoft Store and then uploading it to Cursor. However, once it installed, the Dev-Containers extension did not work properly. I installed the newest version (since it was the only available option) of Dev Containers (v0.381.0). I tested marketplace on a different PC and account and I was able to find Dev Containers (however, it was v0.327.0) and it worked as expected. Couldn’t find a download for that version anywhere so I decided to just address this bug.
			- The issue with Dev Containers v0.381.0 is the VS Code Server not installing properly on Cursor (everything works fine on VS Code on v0.381.0).
			- This is using:

		- [[Person/Terry Li]] recent update [[2025/01]]
			- ## Step 1. Install this safer compatible version
			- `0.327.0` will help download the compatible VS Code Server version:

			- Step 2. Latest compatible version for Cursor + MacOS:
			- After Step 1, we can download and install `0.386.0`, which is tested to be still working as of January 15, 2025
			- ![:warning:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/warning.png?v=12) Directly installing it on Cursor won’t work because it’ll still download the incompatible version of the VS Code Server.
