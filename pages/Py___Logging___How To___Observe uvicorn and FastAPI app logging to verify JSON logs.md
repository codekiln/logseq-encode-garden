- # How To Observe [[uvicorn]] and [[FastAPI]] app [[Logging]] to verify JSON logs
	- Below are a few proven ways an agent can "watch" the JSON that the service writes to the terminal when one runs a [[mise/Task]] like `mise run serve` to bring up a FastAPI application.
	- ## 1 Spin the server up in a subprocess and stream its STDOUT/STDERR
		- `mise run serve` is just a shell wrapper around
		- `uvicorn fastapi_example.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` (as defined in `mise.toml`) repomix-output.
		- Your agent can launch that command exactly once and read the pipes line-by-line:
		- ~~~
		  import subprocess, json, textwrap, os, signal, sys, time
		  
		  # Make sure logs flush immediately
		  env = dict(os.environ, PYTHONUNBUFFERED="1")
		  
		  proc = subprocess.Popen(
		    ["mise", "run", "serve"],
		    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
		    stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,   # merge the two streams
		    text=True,                  # decode bytes ‚Üí str
		    bufsize=1,                  # line-buffered
		    env=env,
		  )
		  
		  try:
		    for raw in proc.stdout:          # blocks until newline
		        line = raw.rstrip()
		        # Skip uvicorn banner lines; parse only JSON
		        if line.startswith("{") and line.endswith("}"):
		            event = json.loads(line)
		            print(f"üîç observed event ‚Üí {event['event']}")
		  finally:
		    proc.send_signal(signal.SIGINT)   # graceful ^C
		    proc.wait(timeout=10)
		  ~~~
		- ## Tips / foot-guns
			- ### Issue: `--reload` starts a **reloader parent** and a **worker child**
				- The parent prints the banner but the child produces most logs. If that bothers you, launch the worker directly with `mise exec uvicorn fastapi_example.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` (no `--reload`).
			- ### Issue: Uvicorn still writes a few banner lines in plain text
				- Just ignore any line that is not valid JSON.
			- ### Issue: Make sure  [[Python/Environment/Variables/PYTHONUNBUFFERED]] is set to 1
				- Already set in the Dockerfile and the compose file so you get logs immediately. repomix-output
		- This is the simplest approach and works in exactly the same way your pytest assertions capture logs with `capsys` in `tests/unit/test_main.py`. repomix-output
	- ## 2 Run Uvicorn **in-process** and attach a custom log handler
		- If your agent is written in Python and you'd like tighter control, import the FastAPI app and start Uvicorn programmatically:
		- ~~~
		  import asyncio, uvicorn, logging, json
		  from fastapi_example.main import app
		  
		  class CaptureHandler(logging.Handler):
		    def emit(self, record):
		        try:
		            event = json.loads(record.getMessage())
		            # do something with event dict here‚Ä¶
		        except json.JSONDecodeError:
		            pass  # ignore banner lines
		  
		  logging.getLogger().addHandler(CaptureHandler())
		  
		  config = uvicorn.Config(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, log_config=None)
		  server = uvicorn.Server(config)
		  
		  asyncio.run(server.serve())
		  ~~~
		- Because you start Uvicorn yourself, there is no reloader process, so every log comes through one handler.
		- You can shut the server down cleanly by calling `await server.shutdown()` or cancelling the asyncio task.
	- ## 3 Create a dedicated **`serve-json`** task in `mise.toml`
		- Sometimes you only need JSON logs (no reloader, no banner) while the agent is running. Add a second task:
		- ~~~
		  [tasks.serve-json]
		  description = "Run FastAPI server without reload, JSON only"
		  run = "uvicorn fastapi_example.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000"
		  ~~~
		- Run it with `mise run serve-json` from the same subprocess wrapper shown in ¬ß 1.
	- ## 4 Use the **[[capsys]] strategy** as a pattern
		- In unit tests one can capture structured logs in-memory and parse them in [[capsys]] assertions.
		- If the agent's job is only to verify "all logs are JSON," you may not need to boot the whole server‚Äîjust import the app, make a request with `httpx.AsyncClient`, and read what lands in `capsys` / `caplog`. That avoids any IPC entirely.
	- ## Choosing the right technique
		- ### End-to-end smoke-test in a separate process
			- Recommended approach: **¬ß 1** subprocess with pipes
		- ### Tight integration, same Python interpreter
			- Recommended approach: **¬ß 2** in-process server + handler
		- ### Quick local run with no reloader noise
			- Recommended approach: **¬ß 3** extra mise task
		- ### Pure "log schema" unit test
			- Recommended approach: **¬ß 4** [[capsys]] strategy
		- All four rely on the fact that `logging.basicConfig(..., stream=sys.stdout, ‚Ä¶)` is already wired to write the JSON your agent cares about.
