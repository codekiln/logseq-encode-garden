# Multiplayer #Art Garden [[Video Game]]
	- [[tldr]] a video game that is a sculpture garden you can attend with your friends. You can talk with your friends or with other people about the art and explore it in various sizes or form factors.
	- [[Impetus]] There's no real digital equivalent for the social, reflective experience of a museum or a sculpture garden. This video game is an environment for viewing, discussing and exploring virtual art created by real artists with your friends and family. It's also a way for people to sponsor artists.
	- [[Basic Idea]]
		- This video game presents a virtual art gallery in a beautiful outdoor sculpture garden. The art is made by "real" artists, optionally in partnership with video game developers, or optionally with AI assistance.
		- People buy tickets to "visit" with their group during a particular time block. There are only a few hours a week when it's open. Proceeds go to the artists.
		- By default, attendees will be in a humanoid shape, but it's not the only way to visit the park.
			- Walking around the park, one may build up reflection points.
			- If desired, all the humanoid members in your party may get on a slow magic carpet. Attendees can go "hamster mode" and crawl around tubes inside and between of the art. Alternatively, they can go "hummingbird mode" and fly around and above the creations.
