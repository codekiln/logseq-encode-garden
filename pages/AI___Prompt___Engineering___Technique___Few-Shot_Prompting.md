- # Few-Shot Prompting
	- ## Overview
		- Few-shot prompting is a technique in [[Prompt Engineering]] where you provide the [[AI/LLM]] with a small number of examples (typically 2-5) to demonstrate the desired input-output pattern before asking it to perform the same task on new inputs
		- This technique helps the model understand the task format, style, and expected behavior without requiring extensive fine-tuning
	- ## How It Works
		- ### Pattern Recognition
			- The model learns from the provided examples to identify patterns in input-output relationships
			- It uses these patterns to generate appropriate responses for new, similar inputs
		- ### Context Learning
			- Examples serve as context that guides the model's understanding of the task
			- The model infers the underlying rules and constraints from the examples
	- ## Best Practices
		- ### Example Selection
			- Choose diverse examples that represent the range of inputs you expect
			- Ensure examples are high-quality and demonstrate the desired output format
			- Include edge cases when relevant
		- ### Format Consistency
			- Maintain consistent formatting across all examples
			- Use clear separators between examples and the actual prompt
		- ### Example Order
			- Place examples in logical order (e.g., simple to complex)
			- Consider the order's impact on the model's learning
