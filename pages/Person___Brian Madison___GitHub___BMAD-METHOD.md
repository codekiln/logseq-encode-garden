	- ## Log
		- ### [[2025-07-18 Fri]] - utilized the [[ScrumMaster]] for the first time
			- This was not intuitive at first, but once I got the hang of it, it was really impressive.
		- ### [[2025-07-17 Thu]] - used `npx bmad-method install` for first time
			- The transition from the [planning workflow in the web](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/docs/user-guide.md#the-planning-workflow-web-ui) to the [Web to UI Transition](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/docs/user-guide.md#web-ui-to-ide-transition).
				- I added a [[PRD]] at `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` to the repo
				- I used `bmad-install` installer to instal bmad agent tools for [[CursorAI]] and [[Claude Code]] using the interactive [[CLI/Tool]].
