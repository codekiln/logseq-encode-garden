# The Abstraction or Meta-Tool Tax in the Age of Accelerating Technology
	- Recent history has brought unprecedented growth in the capabilities of as well as dramatic changes in the shape of technological systems, particularly in and around the use of AI. A history of these changes is outside of the scope of discussion, but as of the time of this writing, [[MCP]] and the rise of mature [[AI/Coding/Agentic]] is not even a year old, and already it is being disrupted by a new shape of the problem in [[Claude Code Skills]].
	- It is important to think about the structure of the costs both developers and users of  tools like [[rulesync]], [[LiteLLM]], [[OpenRouter]] and the [[LangChain]] ecosystem will incur due to the nature of introducing a toolchain abstraction layer over quickly evolving AI tools.
	- One cost is the latency of access to new tools. There is a tension between abstraction layers and the speed of new features being released from providers. This is true at every layer of the AI stack, from APIs to SDKs. A key question: in the era of [[AI Coding]] it may theoretically be more possible to keep up with and adapt with features in the underlying product, but practically speaking, how far behind do abstraction layers tend to be? Is it a penalty of 1-2 months, or more like 6-10 months? The former might be fine, but the latter might be intolerable.
