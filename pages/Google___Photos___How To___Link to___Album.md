# [How do I embed aÂ Google Photos album into a website? - Public album .org](https://www.publicalbum.org/blog/embedding-google-photos-albums)
	- This site contains a form that generates an HTML Embed
	- I have a script that can take the output of that and generates a logseq pics page
		- script TBD publishing; private for now; see [[Person/codekiln/my-logseq-tooling]]
	- It doesn't work as well for videos
		- it is possible to do videos one at a time at [Embed Google Photos video with player into website - Public album .org](https://www.publicalbum.org/blog/embed-google-photos-video). This links to [Make video slideshow for website - Public album .org](https://www.publicalbum.org/blog/make-video-slideshow)  which has instructions on how to hand-write a slideshow that includes videos.
