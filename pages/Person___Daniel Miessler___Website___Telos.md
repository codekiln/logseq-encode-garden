	- This page is a subset of my personal [TELOS](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/how-my-projects-fit-together) file, showing my `problems`, `missions`, `goals`, `metrics`, and a few other TELOS components.
	- ## Problems
		- In line with [this essay](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/plan-career-around-problems), these are what I view as the most important problems in the world.
		- | PID | Problem |
		  | ---------- | ---- | ---- |
		  | P1 | People lack meaning in their lives, and this is about to get far worse because of AI and robotics taking away most traditional jobs |
		  | P2 | People are stuck in a 1950's style hierarchical mindset that makes them think they're not one of the "special ones" with ideas and dreams |
		  | P3 | People have poor models for how the world works, and the lack the tools to properly improve them |
	- ## Missions
		- | MID | Mission |
		  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
		  | M1 | Increase human Eudaimonia by helping people identify, articulate, and pursue their own purpose in life. |
		  | M2 | Build systems—heavily leveraging the latest in AI—that help people upgrade to the best possible version of themselves (Human 3.0). |
		  | M3 | Transfer (or store) my and B's minds into a format that we can upload into the next (digital) version of our lives. |
