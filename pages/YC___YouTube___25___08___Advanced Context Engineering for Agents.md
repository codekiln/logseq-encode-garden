			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 0}} Introduction and Background
				- **Speaker**: [[Person/Dexter Horthy]] [[Role/Founder]] of [[humanlayer]] (YC Fall 24 batch)
				- **Context Engineering History**:
					- Wrote "12 Factor agents - principles of reliable LLM applications" manifesto [[2025-04-22 Tue]] - [[humanlayer/GitHub/12-factor-agents]]
					- Term "context engineering" coined on June 4th
					- Talk titled "12 factor agents" at AI Engineer conference
				- **Current Focus**: Moving beyond basic context engineering to advanced techniques for coding agents
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 55}} Industry Insights and Challenges

					- Context eng: [[Person/Dexter Horthy/YouTube/25/07/12-factor-agents]] 
					  Spec driven coding: [[Person/Sean Grove/YouTube/25/07/The New Code]]
					  Dev Productivity: [[Person/Yegor Denisov-Blanch/YouTube/25/07/Does AI Boost Developer Productivity - 100k Devs Study - Stanford]]
				- #### Sean Grove's "New Code" Talk - [[Person/Sean Grove/YouTube/25/07/The New Code]]
					- **Vibe Coding Problem**: Sitting with agents for hours specifying requirements then discarding prompts
					- **Analogy**: Like Java developers committing compiled JARs instead of source code
					- **Key Insight**: In AI-driven development, specifications and descriptions become the important artifacts
				- #### Stanford Study Findings [[Person/Yegor Denisov-Blanch/YouTube/25/07/Does AI Boost Developer Productivity - 100k Devs Study - Stanford]]
					- **Research Scope**: 100,000 developers across enterprises and startups
					- **Key Finding**: AI engineering leads to significant rework
					- **Limitations**:
						- Doesn't work well for complex or brownfield tasks
						- Can be counterproductive for legacy codebases
						- May actually slow down development in some cases
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 154}} Personal Journey and Transformation
				- #### Forced Adoption of Spec-First Development
					- **Challenge**: Working with AI coder producing 20,000-line Go PRs
					- **Complexity**: Systems code with race conditions, shutdown order, etc.
					- **Solution**: Adopted specification-first development approach
					- **Transformation**: 8-week process from code review to spec review
				- #### Current Workflow
					- **Success Metrics**: Shipped 6 PRs in one Thursday
					- **No Code Files**: Haven't opened non-markdown files in editor for 2 months
					- **Focus**: Reading tests and specs instead of every line of code
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 206}} Advanced Context Engineering Goals
				- #### Core Objectives
					- Works well in big, complex codebases
					- Solves big, complex problems
					- No slop - production-ready code
					- Team stays aligned
					- Maximize token usage efficiently
				- #### Naive Approach Problems
					- Shouting back and forth until context exhaustion
					- Giving up or crying from frustration
					- Inefficient iteration cycles
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 258}} Intentional Compaction Strategy
				- #### When to Start Over
					- **Signs**: Agent going off track, making repeated mistakes
					- **Strategy**: Stop and restart with fresh context
					- **Steering**: Add specific guidance about what not to repeat
				- #### Context Management
					- **Avoid**: `/compact` command (considered ineffective)
					- **Preferred**: Write progress files for context transfer
					- **Purpose**: Onboard next agent into ongoing work
				- #### Context Window Optimization
					- **Space Consumers**: File searching, flow understanding, edits, MCP tool responses
					- **Focus**: Intentional compaction of progress and status
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 307}} Context Engineering Principles
				- #### LLM as Pure Functions
					- **Key Insight**: Only input quality improves output quality
					- **Context Window**: Critical for agent decision-making
					- **Agent Loops**: Constantly determining next tool/action
				- #### Optimization Priorities
					- **Correctness**: Ensure information accuracy
					- **Completeness**: Include all necessary details
					- **Size**: Keep context manageable
					- **Trajectory**: Maintain direction (vibes-based)
				- #### Context Quality Equation
					- **Worst**: Bad information
					- **Second Worst**: Missing information
					- **Third**: Too much noise
					- **Target**: ~170,000 tokens with efficient usage
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 405}} Sub-Agents and Context Control
				- #### Sub-Agent Strategy
					- **Purpose**: Context control and delegation
					- **Common Use**: Finding files, understanding information flow
					- **Workflow**: Parent agent calls sub-agent, gets focused results
					- **Benefit**: Parent avoids context burden of searching/reading
				- #### Sub-Agent Challenges
					- **Telephone Problem**: Information distortion through delegation
					- **Prompting Complexity**: How to instruct parent to instruct child
					- **Deterministic vs Non-deterministic**: Chaos in complex systems
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 452}} Frequent Intentional Compaction
				- #### Development Workflow Phases
					- **Research**: Understand system, identify relevant files, locate problems
					- **Plan**: Specify all changes, testing strategy, verification steps
					- **Implement**: Execute the plan with code generation
				- #### Context Management Target {{youtube-timestamp 540}}
					- **Goal**: ==Keep context utilization under 40%==
					- **Strategy**: Constant plan updates and context refresh
					- **Benefit**: Fresh context window for each phase
				- #### 3 phases - Research, Plann, Implement, each with a prompt
					- **Research Output**: File names, line numbers, system understanding
						-
					- **Planning Output**: Change specifications, testing approach, verification steps
						- "Tell me every single change you're going to make"
						- "Be very specific about how we're going to implement
					- **Open Source**: All prompts available publicly
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 548}} Implementation and Code Review
				- #### Workflow Benefits
					- **Efficiency**: Good plans eliminate need for agent shouting
					- **Quality**: Plans are shorter than code but catch problems early
					- **Human Review**: Research files easier to review than 2000-line PRs
				- #### Code Review Purpose
					- **Mental Alignment**: Keep team aware of system changes
					- **Efficiency**: Review 200-line plans vs 2000-line code
					- **Early Problem Detection**: Catch issues before implementation
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 593}} Real-World Validation
				- #### BAML Codebase Challenge
					- **Scope**: 300,000-line Rust codebase
					- **Approach**: One-shot fix attempt
					- **Result**: PR merged successfully
					- **Validation**: Works in brownfield codebases, no slop
				- #### Complex Problem Solving
					- **Challenge**: Adding WASM support to programming language
					- **Time**: 7 hours with Boundary CEO
					- **Output**: 35,000 lines of code
					- **Efficiency**: 1-2 weeks of work compressed to 7 hours
				- #### Key Insight Hierarchy
					- **Bad Code Line**: One bad line
					- **Bad Plan**: Hundreds of bad lines
					- **Bad Research**: Thousands of bad lines
					- **Focus**: Spend time on problem specification and system understanding
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 650}} Results and Team Transformation
				- #### Success Metrics
					- **Token Usage**: Significant monthly consumption (team of 3)
					- **Efficiency**: Worth the cost due to time savings
					- **Team Growth**: Intern shipped 2 PRs first day, 10 PRs by day 8
				- #### Workflow Transformation
					- **Code Review**: No longer reading code, only specs
					- **Team Adoption**: New communication and work structuring methods
					- **Scalability**: Working with 6-person startups to 1000-person public companies
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 696}} Future Outlook and Next Steps
				- #### Industry Trends
					- **Coding Agents**: Becoming commoditized
					- **Team Transformation**: The hard part of adoption
					- **Communication**: New ways of structuring work
				- #### Human Layer's Role
