		- > The figure on the cover of *Python Concurrency with asyncio* is “Paysanne du Marquisat de Bade,” or Peasant woman of the Marquisate of Baden, taken from a book by Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur published in 1797. Each illustration is finely drawn and colored by hand.
		- > In those days, it was easy to identify where people lived and what their trade or station in life was just by their dress. Manning celebrates the inventiveness and initiative of the computer business with book covers based on the rich diversity of regional culture centuries ago, brought back to life by pictures from collections such as this one.
