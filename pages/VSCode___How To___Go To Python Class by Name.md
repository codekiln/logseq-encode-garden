	- There's **NOT AN EQUIVALENT WAY** to only go to a class, AFAIK. One can only go to a symbol.
	- ### [[VSCode/Keyshort]] for going to a symbol anywhere in the workspace #card
		- Press `Cmd + T` (or `Ctrl + T` on Windows/Linux) to open **Go to Symbol**.
	- ### [[VSCode/Keyshort]] for listing classes in the current file #card
		- Use `Cmd + Shift + O` (`Ctrl + Shift + O` on Windows/Linux) to open the symbol search for the **current file**.
		- Then type `:` to sort by category.
