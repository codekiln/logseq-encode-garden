	- In VS Code, you can filter symbols to show only classes in the **Go to Symbol** (`Cmd + T` on macOS, `Ctrl + T` on Windows/Linux) by using a **prefix** `:class`.
	- ### [[VSCode/Keyshort]] for going to a symbol anywhere in the workspace #card
		- Press `Cmd + T` (or `Ctrl + T` on Windows/Linux) to open **Go to Symbol**.
	- ### [[VSCode/Keyshort]] for listing classes in the current file #card
		- Use `Cmd + Shift + O` (`Ctrl + Shift + O` on Windows/Linux) to open the symbol search for the **current file**.
		- Then type `:` to sort by category.
