		- I am interested in the mundane sounds of everyday life and the uncanny voices of imaginary realms. My works, created for diverse media and performed at numerous venues, have been brought to life by a variety of ensembles and performers around the world, including myself. My current interests include composed theater, sound spatialization, and the physicality and narrativity of sound. I hope my works will always be driven by curiosity, intuition, and passion.

	- ## #Description
		- Become Waves is the second study in my continuing exploration of the narrativity and interactivity among physicality, space, and sound. In this work, sound becomes an imaginary, yet tangible object that is sculpted and projected into the three-dimensional space by the performer’s movement and gestures. Collectively, the concert space transforms into an alternate realm. In this work, The performer triggers, shapes, and diffuses sound in real time. Through sensors, the performer’s movement and gestures are coherently combined with sonic changes. The sensor on performer’s wrist spatializes sound following his/her hand movement, and the stationary sensor enables continuous changes of sonic parameters in the space. After composing the work, I encountered a paragraph from Amy Liptrot’s book—The Outrun—through the film adaptation by director Nora Fingscheidt, which perfectly captures the momentary sensation of fusing my body and movement with the field recordings used in the work. I would like to share it with you: “In grandiose moments, high on fresh air and freedom on the hill, I study my personal geology. My body is a continent. Forces are at work in the night. A bruxist, I grind my teeth in my sleep, like tectonic plates. When I blink the sun flickers, my breath pushes the clouds across the sky and the waves roll into the shore in time with my beating heart. Lightning strikes every time I sneeze, and when I orgasm, there’s an earthquake. The islands’ headlands rise above the sea, like my limbs in the bathtub, my freckles are famous landmarks and my tears rivers. My lovers are tectonic plates and stone cathedrals.” – Amy Liptrot, The Outrun
