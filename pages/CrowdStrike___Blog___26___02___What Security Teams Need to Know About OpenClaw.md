	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- ### Part 1 - How [[CrowdStrike]] can help [[Security/Professional]]s remove [[OpenClaw]] from [[Enterprise]] computers and networks
			- there's a tool to identify installations, remove openclaw, etc
				- not that different from tools used to bittorrent, etc

				- bot *persistence*
		- ### Prompt 2 - [[Prompt Injection]]

				- ![Taxonomy of Prompt Injection Techniques](https://www.crowdstrike.com/content/dam/crowdstrike/marketing/en-us/images/blog/2026/02/openclaw/Blog-Prompt-Injection-Taxonomy-Poster.png)
			- I personally find that other writers (like [[Person/Simon Willison]]) are more compelling when it comes to fostering alert curiosity about the dangers of prompt injection. This kind of infographic, in contrast, puts a glossy sheen on [[FUD]].
