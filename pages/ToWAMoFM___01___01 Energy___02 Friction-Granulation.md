- # [Friction-Granulation](https://sites.inagrm.com/avdg/activities/frottement-granulation.xhtml)
	- [[Friction]] is raw energy between two surfaces that meet
	- It's a gestural model, a model of movement
	- It's a mental representation of the gesture based on what we already know / see
		- {{embed [[Person/Jean Piaget/Proprio-Perceptive]]}}
	- The idea is to move from a sliding state to a stop, to explore all the states, the unstable balances (the [[Grain]]s) between these two poles
	- There's a direct relationship between intention, gesture, and the resulting sounds
	- The deep, emotional meaning is in the gesture: for the musician as well as the dancer, painter, or sculptor, emotion is transmitted through the quality and intense experience of physical gestures that express feeling
	- ## Working Method
		- This is a global model, we think of it more as an improvised sequence-game. We let ourselves be guided by gesture and listening through headphones. The hand-ear couple finds its full justification in this energetic model of [[Friction]]
		- Recording [[Sound Body]]s in direct relationship with the human body
		- The [[Mic]] is part of the [[Instrument]] (or part of how you hold the [[Instrument]])
		- Moving from smooth to [[Granulation]] and to point-like
		- The granular is a type of energy that results from effort:
			- The person listening will feel it, with their own body, because they have a [[Proprio-Perceptive]] knowledge of the same movements
				- [[My Note]]
					- In [[Person/Arthur Schopenhauer/Book/The World as Will and Representation]]
					- > **The body is the only object we know in two ways at once**
						- as *representation* (perceived, spatial, causal)
						- and as *will* (immediate, felt, enacted)
		- Hold things back, let them go
	- ## Commentary
		- [[Friction]] generates a line-point relationship (see [[Person/Paul Klee]])
		- The dynamics of the line, the dynamics of the point, and everything in between
			- moving from one state to another of the same phenomenon
			- the line as the state of rest, the release of the point, the iterative point
			- [[My Note]]
				- *the difference between line and point is [[Bouba Kiki]]*
		- Caliber or size of points between each other, caliber or size of lines between each other
		- Dynamics of movement, which isn't necessarily "straight"
		- [[Friction]] is the energy that most allows the idea of movement to come through
		- It's the most primary, most primitive energy, closest to children between 0 and 2 years old
		- The factor of speed and the typological criterion of matter [[Grain]] come into play as perceptual variations of [[Friction]], as does the criterion of maintenance (iterative): maintenance of the sound cut up and repeated
