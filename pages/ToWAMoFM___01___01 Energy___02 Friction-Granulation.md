- # Friction-Granulation
	- ## Overview
		- Exploration of friction-based energy and granular synthesis in acousmatic music
		- Friction-granulation examines the relationship between continuous friction sounds and granular textural processes
		- Understanding how friction generates granular sound particles and textures
	- ## Key Concepts
		- Friction: Continuous rubbing or scraping that generates sustained sound energy
		- Granulation: The breaking down of sound into small particles or grains
		- Texture: The resulting granular texture from friction-based sound generation
		- Transformation: How friction sounds can be processed into granular textures
	- ## Sound Examples
		- *Note: Sound examples should be added from the website with media player hyperlinks*
