		- #Short
			- Piano with live electronics conceals, erases and re-paints its own material; as timbres disappear into processed shadows, the work asks how performers mask emotion in a technological veil.
		- #Long
			- Camouflage is a work for piano and live electronics. All of the electronics are created from sounds sampled and controlled in real-time by the piano and act as an extension of the instrument, creating a hybrid electro-acoustic entity. In the first section of the work, the computer responds to the piano attacks with rhythmic patterns built from processed versions of the chord that triggered the pattern. This gives the music a regular pulsing rhythm without resorting to a fixed track and allowing the performer control over the musical expression and flow. As the piece progresses, an underlying harmonic progression hinted at from the beginning, gradually becomes more prominent, enhanced by sustaining electronics, creating blurry impressionistic washes of color. As the piano moves increasingly towards an ecstatic outburst of Romanticism the electronics respond by becoming increasingly noisy and aggressive, eventually departing from the performerâ€™s direct control, and attempting to suppress and hide the emotions displayed by the human performer.
