- # OER Cartridges
  - A packaged course format, usually conforming to a standard like [[IMS/Common Cartridge]], which bundles:
    - Pages and readings (usually HTML)
    - Quizzes ([[IMS/QTI]] format)
    - Discussion prompts
    - Linked external tools (via [[LTI]])
    - Metadata (title, description, license, subject, etc.)
  - OER Cartridge is a Common Cartridge file containing OER, often shared via repositories (e.g., OER Commons, OpenStax, LibreTexts), enabling instructors to import a full or partial course into their [[LMS]] ([[Canvas]], [[Moodle]], [[Blackboard]]) with minimal effort.
  - ## ðŸ“¦ Metadata
    - OER cartridges often include [[Dublin Core Metadata]] or [[IEEE/LOM]] metadata so:
      - Repositories can index them by topic, level, subject.
      - LMSs can display useful details (e.g., license type, creator).
      - Users can search/filter based on learning outcomes or prerequisites.
  - ## âœ… Example Use Case
    - A faculty member downloads a "Business Ethics" OER cartridge from a repository. When imported into Canvas:
      - The structure (modules, readings, quizzes) appears in the LMS.
      - Metadata tags make the content easy to catalog and remix.
