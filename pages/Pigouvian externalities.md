- # Pigouvian Externalities Conceptual Overview
	- ## Overview
		- **Pigouvian** means "related to [[Person/Arthur Cecil Pigou]]."
		- Pigouvian externalities describe costs or benefits created by one party but experienced by third parties.
		- Classic example: pollution imposes health and environmental costs on people not involved in the original transaction.
	- ## Context
		- Markets allocate resources through private costs and private benefits.
		- When third-party effects are not priced in, market outcomes can become socially inefficient.
		- Pigou's contribution was to frame this gap between private and social outcomes in a way policy can address.
	- ## Key Principles
		- **Negative externality**: private activity imposes outside costs (for example, emissions).
		- **Positive externality**: private activity creates outside benefits (for example, vaccination spillovers).
		- **Social cost/benefit** can differ from **private cost/benefit**.
	- ## Mechanism
		- A **Pigouvian tax** raises the private cost of a harmful activity to better reflect its social cost.
		- A Pigouvian subsidy can encourage activities with positive spillover benefits.
		- The policy goal is to align private incentives with social welfare.
	- ## Examples
		- Carbon taxes on emissions.
		- Congestion charges in crowded city centers.
		- Subsidies for preventive health measures that reduce broader public costs.
	- ## Misconceptions
		- Pigouvian policy is not only about taxes; subsidies can also be Pigouvian.
		- It is not about punishment; it is about pricing external costs or benefits more accurately.
