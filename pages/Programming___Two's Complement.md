- # [Two's Complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement)
	- A mathematical operation on binary numbers and the most common method for representing signed integers in computing
	- Simplifies arithmetic operations and eliminates the issue of having two representations for zero
	- ## Overview
		- The most significant bit (MSB) indicates the sign of the number:
			- `0` for positive numbers
			- `1` for negative numbers
		- Positive numbers are represented as usual in binary
		- Negative numbers are represented by inverting all bits of their absolute value (one's complement) and adding one to the least significant bit (LSB)
	- ## Range
		- For an n-bit binary number:
			- The range of representable integers is from `-2^(n-1)` to `2^(n-1) - 1`
			- For example, an 8-bit system can represent integers from `-128` to `127`
	- ## Advantages
		- ### Single Zero Representation
			- Unlike one's complement, which has both `00000000` and `11111111` representing zero, two's complement has a unique representation (`00000000`)
		- ### Simplified Arithmetic
			- Addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations are the same for both signed and unsigned numbers
			- Simplifies hardware design
			- No need for separate signed and unsigned arithmetic circuits
	- ## Converting to Two's Complement
		- To find the two's complement of a binary number:
			- 1. Invert all bits (one's complement)
			- 2. Add one to the LSB
		- ### Example: Representing -5 in 8-bit
			- Start with the binary representation of `5`: `00000101`
			- Invert all bits: `11111010`
			- Add one: `11111011`
			- Thus, `-5` is represented as `11111011` in 8-bit two's complement
	- ## Arithmetic Operations
		- ### Addition
			- Add the binary numbers directly
			- If there's a carry out of the MSB, it's discarded
		- ### Subtraction
			- Convert the number to be subtracted into its two's complement
			- Add it to the other number
		- ### Example: Computing 5 - 3 in 4-bit
			- Represent `5`: `0101`
			- Represent `3`: `0011`
			- Find two's complement of `3`:
				- Invert bits: `1100`
				- Add one: `1101`
			- Add `5` and `-3`:
				- `0101` + `1101` = `10010`
				- Discard the carry: `0010` (which is `2` in decimal)
	- ## Sign Extension
		- When increasing the number of bits (e.g., from 8-bit to 16-bit), the sign bit (MSB) is extended to preserve the number's value
		- **Positive numbers**: Pad with `0`s
		- **Negative numbers**: Pad with `1`s
		- ### Example
			- Extending `-5` (`11111011` in 8-bit) to 16-bit: `11111111 11111011`
	- ## Historical Context
		- The concept of two's complement has been integral to computer arithmetic since the mid-20th century
		- Notably utilized in early computers like the IBM System/360, introduced in 1964
		- This contributed to its widespread adoption in the computing industry
