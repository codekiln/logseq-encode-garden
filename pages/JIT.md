- # JIT Conceptual Overview
	- ## Overview
		- JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation translates code during program execution instead of fully ahead of time.
		- It balances flexibility and speed by compiling only the code paths that are actually used.
		- JIT is common in managed runtimes and dynamic binary translation systems.
	- ## Context
		- Pure interpretation is flexible but can be slow for repeated execution.
		- Full ahead-of-time compilation can be fast but less adaptive to runtime behavior.
		- JIT emerged as a middle path: start quickly, then optimize hot paths as execution data becomes available.
	- ## Key Principles
		- **Profile-guided optimization**
			- Runtime profiling identifies frequently executed paths ("hot" code).
		- **Adaptive compilation**
			- The system can recompile with stronger optimizations as confidence increases.
		- **Tiered execution**
			- Many systems begin with interpretation or baseline codegen, then graduate to optimized native code.
		- **Cost tradeoff**
			- Compilation work at runtime adds overhead up front but can repay that cost for long-running workloads.
	- ## Mechanism
		- The runtime starts by executing bytecode or an intermediate form.
		- It records counters, types, and branch behavior to guide optimization decisions.
		- Hot sections are compiled to machine code and cached for reuse.
		- Some engines perform deoptimization when earlier assumptions are invalidated.
	- ## Examples
		- JavaScript engines JIT-compile frequently executed functions to speed up web app execution.
		- JVM runtimes optimize hot methods based on observed runtime types.
		- [[QEMU]] can use JIT-style dynamic binary translation for cross-architecture emulation.
	- ## Misconceptions
		- JIT always makes every program faster -> **False**. Short-lived programs may not run long enough to recover compilation overhead.
		- JIT means no interpretation occurs -> **False**. Many systems use interpretation or baseline execution before optimized tiers.
		- JIT is only for high-level languages -> **False**. It is also used in emulators and VM systems.
