		- **Give your JavaScript resources unique names**. While it is tempting and common to call a JavaScript file something like index.js, this can cause conflicts due to the flat path structure that Max uses if there are multiple files called index.js elsewhere in Max’s search path. If Max detects such an issue, you’ll see a warning in the Max console.
