- # Metaprogramming
	- > **Metaprogramming** is a [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) technique in which [computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) have the ability to treat other programs as their [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data). It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyse, or transform other programs, and even modify itself, while running.
