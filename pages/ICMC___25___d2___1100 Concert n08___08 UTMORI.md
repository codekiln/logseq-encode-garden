- # UTMORI
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- 20:38 about a minute in
		- 20:44 pleasant enough to listen to.
		- some organ tones usher us in, now little clipped sounds have a second section. Sounds "more like Berklee"
		- some bird sounds, these are popular at this conference
		- I'm not connecting with this quite as much, but it is cool enough. It's fairly minimal; maybe if I was biking around this would be fun to listen to? Yea, it seems like great [[Sound/Diegetic]]
	- ## #Description
		- **UTMORI** is a generative composition that explores how intangible, pre-sonic forms what might be called potentials rather than sounds can become the material of music. Drawing inspiration from the asymmetric pulse of eotmori, the piece unfolds not through fixed rhythms or melodies, but through the shaping of invisible contours: abstract energies that hover beneath perception, waiting to be pulled into form. Here, music is not composed in notes, but in tendencies curves, weights, and tensions moving through an unseen space. These latent forces are sculpted and sequenced into what might be understood as sonic objects: entities that carry emotional density without adhering to fixed pitch or rhythm. They emerge, shift, dissolve, and reconfigure, producing textures that feel both rooted and uncertain, familiar yet indeterminate. Rather than treating tradition as something to be preserved or replicated, UTMORI draws from its spirit of openness and transformation. This work extends that logic into a generative system where even the act of listening becomes unstable. Nothing repeats exactly, yet everything carries memory. In this process, the boundary between sound and structure blurs, and the work becomes less a composition than an evolving encounter with the possible.

			- **Junson Park** is a Korean artist whose work interrogates the boundaries between technology, perception, and human emotion. With a background in Electronic Production and Design from [[School/Berklee]] Berklee College of Music and an MFA in Music Technology from CalArts, he investigates how machine learning systems can operate not simply as tools of automation, but as perceptual infrastructures that condition, distort, and expand sensory and cognitive experience. His research focuses on how algorithmic systems particularly those involving generative audio, visual reconfiguration, and real-time interaction can function as agents of affective modulation, reframing the dynamics between control, intention, and emergent behavior within aesthetic practice.
