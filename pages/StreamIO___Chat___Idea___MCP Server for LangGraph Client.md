- # Create a [[MCP/Server]] for [[StreamIO/Chat]] that would let a #langgraph [[MCP/Client]] share [[MCP/Resource]] state with a #React front end for a dynamic user interface
	- ## #[[Use Cases]]
		- using the [[StreamIO/Chat/ReactSDK]] to build a chat component that has a rich, interactive interface whose state must be shared with, understood by, and operated upon by an [[AI/LLM/System]] implemented in LangGraph.
	- ## #[[Theory]]
		- ### Shared State between AI and Front-End
			- MCP Resources could be a good fit for creating dynamic, interactive [[UIs]] with LLM systems, because they allow for sharing state between the client and the front-end. One could write an MCP server that wraps the [[StreamIO/Chat/PySDK]] with respect to reading or updating [[StreamIO/Chat/Message]] or [[StreamIO/Chat/Channel]] attachments.
		- ### Possibility to make a reusable, general-purpose StreamIO to LangGraph connection
			- At the current moment, one needs to write an event handler to translate StreamIO events into LangGraph invocations. In theory, it might be possible to make a general-purpose StreamIO MCP server, and then accept events from that in LangGraph.
			- #### #Questions
				- ##### TODO would it be possible for an [[MCP/Server]] to use [[SSE]] to propagate new messages or new message updates into the LangGraph system? Or would we still need to generate event handler code?
				- ##### TODO currently, each LangGraph graph has a single [[LangGraph/Start Node]]. Can it accept [[async]] events from outside the graph?
