- Configuration management is the practice of systematically handling changes to a system's configuration to maintain integrity over time.
	- In a developer context, this often refers to managing [[dotfile]]s and other settings across machines and [[Environment]]s.
	- ## Approaches
		- **Dotfiles repositories** — versioning configuration files in a [[dotfile/dotfiles repo]] using [[source/control/management]] tools like [[git]]
		- **Dedicated tools** — tools like [[chezmoi]] that manage dotfiles across multiple machines with templating support
		- **Infrastructure as Code** — tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef that manage configuration at scale
