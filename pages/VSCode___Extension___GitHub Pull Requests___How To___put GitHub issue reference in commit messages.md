	- When one uses [[VSCode/Command/GitHub Pull Requests/Focus on/Issues View]], selects an issue, right clicks, selects "Start Working on Issue," it is *supposed* to start adding the [[GitHub/Issue]] reference number in commit messages
	- I have noticed that while **this works on the first commit message**, but **it doesn't always seem to persist to subsequent commit messages**
