- # Microtonal Autotune
	- After listening to [[The Sonny Downs Quartet]]'s [[Buchla/200e]] music, which uses [[Music/Scale/Just Intonation]], and getting my ears bit crushed by [[Music/Artist/Charli xcx]], it made me wonder what it would sound like to have clushy just intonation autotune.
	- Apparently [[Ableton/Max for Live/Autotune for Ableton Live]] [Autotune for Ableton Live - Side Brain](https://sidebrain.net/autotune-for-ableton-live-free-download/) has an ability to import [[ScalaScale]] files.
