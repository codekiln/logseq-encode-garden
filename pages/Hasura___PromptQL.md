- # [PromptQL: A Query Language for LLM Interactions](https://promptql.hasura.io/)
	- ## Overview
		- PromptQL is a declarative query language developed by Hasura that enables structured interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs)
		- It provides a standardized way to compose, validate, and execute prompts while maintaining type safety and reproducibility
	- ## Key Problems Solved
		- ### Prompt Engineering Challenges
			- Traditional prompt engineering often involves unstructured text that's difficult to version, test, and maintain
			- Prompts can be inconsistent across different parts of an application
			- No standardized way to validate inputs and outputs
			- Limited reusability of prompt components
		- ### Type Safety and Validation
			- Raw LLM responses often lack structure and type safety
			- Manual parsing and validation of responses is error-prone
			- Difficult to ensure consistent output formats across different prompts
		- ### Composition and Reusability
			- Traditional prompts are often monolithic and hard to modularize
			- Difficult to share and reuse prompt components across projects
			- Limited ability to compose complex workflows from simpler components
	- ## Core Features
		- ### Declarative Syntax
			- SQL-like syntax that's familiar to developers
			- Clear separation of concerns between prompt structure and content
			- Built-in support for variables and parameters
		- ### Type System
			- Strong typing for inputs and outputs
			- Schema validation for LLM responses
			- Support for complex nested structures
		- ### Composability
			- Ability to create reusable prompt components
			- Support for prompt chaining and workflows
			- Built-in templating and variable substitution
	- ## Why It's Interesting for AI Engineers
		- ### Development Efficiency
			- Reduces boilerplate code for LLM interactions
			- Provides a structured approach to prompt engineering
			- Enables faster iteration and testing of prompts
		- ### Quality and Reliability
			- Type safety reduces runtime errors
			- Built-in validation ensures consistent outputs
			- Easier to test and debug prompt workflows
		- ### Scalability
			- Reusable components speed up development
			- Standardized approach makes it easier to maintain large applications
			- Better collaboration through shared prompt libraries
		- ### Integration Capabilities
			- Works with multiple LLM providers
			- Can be integrated into existing applications
			- Supports both simple and complex use cases
	- ## Example Usage
		- Here's a simple example of a PromptQL query:
			- ~~~sql
			  DEFINE PROMPT Summarize(
			    input: string,
			    style: enum("concise", "detailed")
			  ) RETURNS {
			    summary: string,
			    key_points: array<string>
			  } AS $$
			    Summarize the following text in a {{style}} manner:
			    {{input}}
			  $$;
			  ~~~
	- ## Future Implications
		- ### Standards and Best Practices
			- Could become an industry standard for LLM interactions
			- Promotes better prompt engineering practices
			- Enables sharing of prompt libraries and components
		- ### Tooling and Ecosystem
			- Development of IDE support and tools
			- Creation of package managers for prompts
			- Integration with existing development workflows
		- ### Enterprise Adoption
			- Easier integration of LLMs into enterprise systems
			- Better governance and control over LLM interactions
			- Reduced development and maintenance costs
