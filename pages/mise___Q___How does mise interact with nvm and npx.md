tags:: Q, nvm, npx

- # How does mise interact with [[nvm]]?
	- mise is designed to replace nvm's functionality for managing Node.js versions
	- Key points about mise and nvm interaction:
		- mise can import existing nvm installations using `mise sync`
			~~~sh
			$ mise sync node --nvm
			~~~
		- After importing, you can use those nvm-installed versions through mise
		- You generally should choose either mise or nvm as your node version manager, not both
			- Running both could lead to conflicts in PATH and version management
	- Benefits of using mise over nvm:
		- mise manages multiple tools beyond just Node.js
		- mise has better performance since it's written in Rust
		- mise supports modern features like:
			- TOML configuration
			- Multiple versions active at once
			- Project-specific environment variables
			- Task running capabilities

- # How does mise interact with npx?
	- npx is part of the npm ecosystem and works normally with mise-managed Node installations
	- When using a mise-managed Node version:
		- npx will use the correct version of Node based on your mise configuration
		- No special configuration is needed - npx just works as expected
		- The npx binary is available in the mise shim directory or through the activated environment

- # Migration from nvm to mise
	- To migrate from nvm to mise:
		- 1. Install mise
		- 2. Import existing nvm installations if desired:
			~~~sh
			$ mise sync node --nvm
			~~~
		- 3. Set your desired Node version:
			~~~sh
			$ mise use -g node@lts
			~~~
		- 4. Remove nvm from your shell configuration
		- 5. Add mise activation to your shell configuration
