	- ## #Description
		- Brompton & Braeswood is an acousmatic piece inspired by my personal experience living through [[Hurricane]] Harvey on the Gulf Coast of Texas. The title derives from the street intersection where my wife and I were living at the time, along Brays Bayou in Houston.
			- Central to my piece is a ==library of field recordings I captured== at that intersection and along the bayou in the days immediately prior to Harvey making landfall. Some of these recordings were made with a Soundfield SPS-200 microphone; others were made with a matched pair of DPA miniature omni microphones clipped to the brim of a baseball cap, which allowed me to capture a quasi-binaural stereo image. In composing “Brompton & Braeswood,” I sought to present a series of vignettes of contrasting mood and representation. The piece’s opening presents the imagery and emotion of a violent storm. The storm is initially heard directly, then — after a door slams shut — from the perspective of someone taking shelter. The remainder of the piece depicts the gentle but unrelenting, oppressive rainfall that accompanied the hurricane, and there is a marked shift in the music which draws the listener inward toward a place of introspection. At the time Harvey struck Houston, I had just arrived home from the hospital to recover from a major surgery, following a long period of illness. “Brompton & Braeswood” draws on my contemporaneous thoughts and feelings: those of intense worry and gloom, but also of optimism that my health would improve. Aside from field recordings, other sound materials include noisy tones synthesized in [[c74/msp]], pitched wood, and #Piano and #Guitar samples. Sound was spatialized using [[Sound/Recording/Ambisonic/5th Order]] 5th-order ambisonic encoding. The piece explores electroacoustic techniques of amplitude envelope following, filtering, and synthesis using bandpass-filtered white noise, and combines aesthetics and approaches from acousmatic, environmental soundscape, and ambient genres. “Brompton & Braeswood” was commissioned by New Music on the Bayou and premiered during their 2023 festival edition in Monroe, Louisiana. The work was awarded Second Prize in the 2024 SoundChain International Composition Competition.
