- # [CATAPULT â€“ cmi5 Advanced Testing Application and Player Underpinning Learning Technologies](https://www.adlnet.gov/projects/cmi5-CATAPULT/) - [[cmi5]]
	- **CATAPULT** is a conformance testing toolkit developed by [[US/Gov/ADL]] (Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative) to support the adoption of [[xAPI]] and [[cmi5]] standards across learning technologies.

	- ## ðŸ§ª Purpose
		- CATAPULT provides tools that allow developers and system integrators to:
			- Validate the behavior of cmi5 content packages
			- Confirm that LMSs and learning tools conform to the cmi5 specification
			- Encourage widespread adoption of cmi5 and xAPI by offering a testable standard
	- ## ðŸ”§ Key Capabilities
		- **Launch and validate AUs ([[cmi5/AU|Assignable Units]])** in a simulated [[LMS]] environment
		- **Run tests** against LMS implementations to ensure they handle cmi5 correctly
		- **Evaluate xAPI statements** to confirm correct structure and sequencing
		- **Generate logs** and reports for debugging and certification efforts
	- ## ðŸ§  Context in ADL Ecosystem
		- Developers use tools like CATAPULT for validation when building systems that:
			- Replace or extend legacy [[SCORM]] workflows
			- Integrate [[cmi5]] into [[LMS]]s and [[xAPI/LRS]]s
			- Participate in a broader **Total Learning Architecture (TLA)**
