- In anthropology (and closely related fields like psychology and linguistics), **bouba / kiki** refers to the **Bouba–Kiki effect**: a robust cross-cultural tendency for people to associate certain **sounds** with certain **shapes**.

- ### The basic finding
	- When shown two shapes—one **rounded**, one **spiky**—and asked which is called *bouba* and which is *kiki*:
		- **Bouba** → rounded, soft, blobby shape
		- **Kiki** → sharp, angular, spiky shape
	- This holds across:
		- languages
		- cultures
		- ages (including young children)
		- even among people with little exposure to Western writing systems
- ### Where it comes from
	- The effect was first observed by [[Person/Wolfgang Köhler]] in the 1920s (originally using *takete* and *maluma*). Later replications standardized *bouba/kiki*.
