- # [git reset](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset)
	- ## Overview
		- `git reset` is a command that updates the repository state by moving the current branch pointer and optionally modifying the working directory and staging area
		- Primary purpose is to undo changes or move the branch pointer to a different commit
	- ## Core Components
		- ### Command Structure
			- Basic syntax: `git reset [options] [commit]`
			- Common options:
				- `--soft`: Only moves HEAD and branch pointer
				- `--mixed`: Default mode; moves HEAD and updates staging area
				- `--hard`: Moves HEAD, updates staging area, and working directory
		- ### Reset Modes
			- #### Soft Reset [[git/reset/--soft]]
				- Only moves the branch pointer
				- Keeps all changes in staging area
				- Example: `git reset --soft HEAD~1`
				- Use case: Undo last commit while keeping changes staged
			- #### Mixed Reset [[git/reset/--mixed]]
				- Default mode if no option specified
				- Moves branch pointer and unstages changes
				- Example: `git reset HEAD~1`
				- Use case: Undo commit and staging, keep changes in working directory
			- #### Hard Reset (`--hard`) [[git/reset/--hard]]
				- Most aggressive mode
				- Moves branch pointer and discards all changes
				- Example: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
				- Use case: Completely discard commits and revert to previous state
				- See [[git/How To/Discard Changes to Working Dir]] for step-by-step instructions
		- ### Common Reference Points
			- `HEAD~n`: Move back n commits from current position
			- `HEAD^`: Move to parent commit
			- Commit hash: Reset to specific commit
			- Branch name: Reset to tip of another branch
	- ## Technical Details
		- ### Safety Considerations
			- Hard reset can permanently lose work
			- ### The Reflog [[git/reflog]]
				- Git's reference log (reflog) is a safety mechanism that records all changes to branch tips and HEAD
				- Maintains a local history of where HEAD and branch references have been
				- Entries persist for 30 days by default (configurable)
				- Common reflog commands:
					- `git reflog`: View the reflog history
					- `git reflog show <branch>`: View reflog for specific branch
					- `git reset HEAD@{n}`: Reset to nth previous HEAD position
				- Use cases:
					- Recover from accidental hard reset
					- Find lost commits after branch deletion
					- Undo git operations that moved HEAD
			- Recommended to create backup branch before major resets
		- ### Limitations
			- Cannot reset individual files in committed state
			- Does not work on untracked files
			- Cannot undo after pushing to remote (use [[Git/revert]] instead)
