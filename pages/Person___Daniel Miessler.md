- > My name is Daniel Miessler *(MEE-slur)* and I'm an AI/Security researcher and entrepreneur based out of the San Francisco Bay Area. I started this site in 1999 as a platform for writing and archiving my own technical knowledge. Today it has over 3,000 essays, tutorials, articles, and other types of content, and it serves as my interim [DAEMON](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/how-my-projects-fit-together) before I have one officially.
