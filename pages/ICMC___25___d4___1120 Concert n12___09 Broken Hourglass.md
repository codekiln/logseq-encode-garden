		- 18:58 love the splattery bass.
		- slow helicopter effect, what is the whirring
		- buzzing it reminds me of a light for an aquarium
		- now in the back we have some rubbing acceleration, like a gliss on a double bass, but it's behind veils, distortion choirs.
		- 19:04 minor ninths.
		- The bass swoops up and then falls down.
		- so many splatters. ok, space is revealed now

	- ## #Description
		- #Short
			- An electroacoustic work that explores the concept of time through granular synthesis of bowed-metal recordings, creating a sonic landscape that challenges our perception of temporal flow.
		- #Long
			- transformation of sound through

				- filtering

				- heavily processed
					- acoustic textures
					- glitch-like bursts
					- resonant harmonic material
						- *tenths*
					- evolving within
						- a dynamic spatial environment.
						- The work unfolds as layers of filtered instrumental sounds interact
						- [[Sound/Sample/EM Field]] electromagnetic recordings captured on a [[Transport/Train]] journey,
							- glitchy, unstable bursts
								- generated by ==chaotic circuits==
				- Over time, rhythmic elements accelerate and shift in texture
					- dense, immersive climax.
				- concluding with a fragmented decay,
					- leaving behind traces of its earlier gestures.

					- reflects the way time can feel distorted*
						- rushing forward or slipping away
						- unnoticed
					- granular textures
					- pulsing rhythms
					- ==spectral transformations==
					- evokes a world where time fractures and dissolves
					- like the hidden sounds it reveals

		- **Hector Bravo Benard** – Originally from Mexico City, studied philosophy and music at the University of Victoria (Canada), and later at the Xenakis Centre (France), the Institute of Sonology and the Royal and Rotterdam Conservatories (Netherlands), the Autonomous National University of Mexico, the University of Washington’s DXARTS center (USA), and the University of Birmingham (UK). He writes sound-based music for acoustic instruments, live electronics, and fixed media, with a focus on timbral and spatial elements. His works have been presented internationally at events such as the ICMC, BEAST FEaST, SEAMUS, Gaudeamus, New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, Sonorities Belfast, Espacios Sonoros, ACMA, and the Kyma International Sound Symposium. Currently lives in the Netherlands, working as an independent artist and music software developer.
