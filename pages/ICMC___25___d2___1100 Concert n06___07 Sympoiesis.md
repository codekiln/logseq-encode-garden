		- Sympoiesis
			- [[Person/Pauline Oliveros]] reported on recent advances in the “Expanded Instrument System,” or EIS, at the 1991 ICMC in Montreal. In their paper, co-authored with Panaiotis, the term EIS referred back to Oliveros’ studio improvisations produced with tape-delay during the 1960s, and looked forward to the emerging possibilities for distributed algorithmic control of time delays. Oliveros had returned in the 1980s to delay processing in works such as Roots of the Moment and Crone Music, and then, in 1990 at the Banff Centre, ventured into computer-control of sound and light in an ensemble sonic meditation called The Lightning Box. Within a decade, the EIS was revamped as a MAX/MSP patch, and Oliveros characterized the system as a multi-modal “time machine” in which present, past, and future occur “simultaneously with transformations.” Oliveros continued to work on EIS till her passing in 2016, branching into improvisational agents, inter-media systems, and instrument design across abilities. Oliveros’ vision for EIS enlarged with its technical capacities: “I fully expect EIS to become more and more intelligent and self-determining so that someday, it will be able to make music that no human could dream of making. When that future border is crossed – when EIS is no longer an extension of my being, but half of a reciprocal merger of humanity and computer — my music will be a new birth cry from and of post-humanity.” The final version of EIS has four modules, each with its own way of modulating time delayed sounds. One emulates the 1980s Lexicon PCM 42, noted for its smooth pitch modulations. A second has a much longer delay buffer – up to 100 seconds – with control functions that vary the rate and depth of LFO modulation. The third module has a pair of 20 delay lines allowing for individual algorithmic control of each delay – allowing for up to 40 voices with discrete modulators along various scales of indeterminacy and temporal density. A fourth module renders output through ambisonic panners with assignable geometric shapes, enabling what Oliveros liked to refer to as spatial progressions: “[Listeners will] experience the relationship of moving in space in relation to sounds moving in the same space while the space itself is changing.” This performance showcases the EIS as a co-creative improvising agent in a duet performance. The title, Sympoiesis, means “making with,” and following its usage by Donna Haraway, the term befits the kind of “art-science worlding” Oliveros was fabulating in the Expanded Instrument System. Century plays a free bass accordion, following Oliveros’ re-conception of the instrument as a stereophonic musical source producing long continuous sound with irregular envelopes and prominent combination tones. Layton’s 17-string bass guitar was custom-built and is played in the manner of a Pythagorean lyre, capable of unusual harmonic and resonant effects.
