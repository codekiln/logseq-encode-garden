# [1Password SSH agent | 1Password Developer](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=oph&utm_campaign=macos)
	- ## Configuration
		- By default, the 1Password SSH agent will make every [eligible key](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/#eligible-keys) in the built-in [Personal](https://support.1password.com/1password-glossary/#personal-vault), [Private](https://support.1password.com/1password-glossary/#private-vault), or [Employee](https://support.1password.com/1password-glossary/#employee-vault) vault of your 1Password accounts available to offer to SSH servers. This configuration is automatically set up when you [turn on the SSH agent](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/get-started/#step-3-turn-on-the-1password-ssh-agent).
		- If you need to use the SSH agent with keys saved in shared or custom vaults, you can create and customize an [SSH agent config file](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/config/) (`~/.config/1Password/ssh/agent.toml`) to override the default agent configuration.
	- ## Eligible Keys
		- For the 1Password SSH agent to work with your SSH keys, your 1Password SSH key items must meet the following requirements. They must be:
			- [Generated](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/manage-keys/#generate-an-ssh-key) or [imported](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/manage-keys/#import-an-ssh-key) using the `SSH Key` item type (which supports [`Ed25519` or `RSA`](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/manage-keys/#supported-ssh-key-types) key types).
			- Stored in the vaults [the SSH agent is configured to use](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=oph&utm_campaign=macos#configuration) in 1Password. By default, this is the [Personal](https://support.1password.com/1password-glossary/#personal-vault), [Private](https://support.1password.com/1password-glossary/#private-vault), or [Employee](https://support.1password.com/1password-glossary/#employee-vault) vault of any 1Password account you're signed in to.
			- Active items (not archived or deleted).
		- Any key meeting these requirements will automatically be available in the SSH agent for authentication. You will still be required to explicitly [authorize any request](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/security/#authorization-model) an SSH client makes to use your keys.
		- To see a list of all keys that the agent has available, [set the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/get-started/#step-4-configure-your-ssh-or-git-client) and run:
			- `ssh-add -l`
