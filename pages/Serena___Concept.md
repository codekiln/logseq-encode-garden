- # [Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena) Conceptual Overview
	- ## Overview
		- Serena is a coding agent toolkit that transforms [[LLM]]s into sophisticated coding agents through semantic code understanding
		- Provides IDE-quality code intelligence to AI systems via the [[Model Context Protocol]] ([[MCP]])
		- Enables direct, intelligent interaction with codebases across 15+ programming languages
		- Open-source (MIT licensed) and [[LLM]]-agnostic
	- ## Context
		- Traditional AI coding assistants often struggle with large codebases due to:
			- Token limitations requiring extensive context
			- Lack of semantic understanding of code structure
			- Difficulty navigating complex relationships between code elements
		- Serena addresses these challenges by providing:
			- Symbol-level code operations
			- Type-aware semantic understanding
			- Efficient, targeted code retrieval
			- Cross-file code analysis
	- ## Key Principles
		- **Semantic Code Understanding** - Uses [[Language Server Protocol]] ([[LSP]]) for IDE-quality code intelligence beyond surface-level text processing
		- **LLM-Agnostic Architecture** - Works with various AI assistants (Claude, Codex, Gemini, etc.), avoiding model lock-in
		- **Token Efficiency** - Retrieves only relevant code through precise semantic analysis
		- **Multi-Language Support** - Unified interface across 15+ programming languages
		- **Flexible Integration** - Supports multiple client types and integration patterns
		- **Protocol-First Design** - Clean separation of concerns:
			- Code Analysis (LSP layer)
			- Tool Execution
			- AI Orchestration
			- Client-agnostic User Interface
	- ## Mechanism
		- ### Core Architecture
			- **SerenaAgent** - Central orchestrator managing:
				- Project state and configuration
				- Tool registry and discovery
				- Language server integration
				- Context management
			- **Language Server Integration** - Leverages LSP through SolidLanguageServer framework:
				- Automatic language server management
				- Semantic analysis and type checking
				- Symbol resolution and navigation
			- **Tool System** - Over 30 specialized tools for code manipulation, organized in layers:
				- *Semantic Analysis Tools* - `find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview`
				- *Intelligent Editing Tools* - `replace_symbol_body`
				- *Context Management Tools* - Cross-session memory and insights
				- Dynamically configurable based on context
			- **Memory System** - Persistent project knowledge:
				- Stores insights in `.serena/memories/` directory
				- Maintains context across conversation sessions
				- Enables continuity in long-term project work
		- ### Integration Patterns
			- **MCP Server** - Implements Model Context Protocol for standardized AI integration
			- **Multiple Client Support**:
				- Claude Desktop/Code
				- VSCode extensions
				- Terminal clients
				- Web interfaces
				- OpenAPI-compatible systems
			- **Communication Modes**:
				- stdio (standard input/output)
				- HTTP server
	- ## Examples
		- ### Finding a Symbol
			- Agent requests: "Find the definition of `calculateTotal` function"
			- Serena uses LSP to locate exact definition across project
			- Returns precise code location and context
			- Avoids retrieving entire files or searching text patterns
		- ### Cross-File Analysis
			- Agent needs to understand how a class is used
			- Serena finds all references across the codebase
			- Provides type-aware information about each usage
			- Enables accurate refactoring suggestions
		- ### Token-Efficient Context
			- Traditional approach: Send entire files to LLM (high token cost)
			- Serena approach: Send only relevant symbols and references (low token cost)
			- Result: More accurate responses with lower costs
	- ## Misconceptions
		- **Serena is a code editor** → **False**. Serena is a toolkit that provides semantic code understanding to AI agents, which can then perform editing operations.
		- **Serena replaces language servers** → **False**. Serena leverages existing language servers through LSP to provide semantic analysis.
		- **Serena only works with specific LLMs** → **False**. The architecture is LLM-agnostic and works with any AI system that can call tools.
		- **Serena is limited to a few languages** → **False**. Through LSP, Serena supports 15+ programming languages with a unified interface.
	- ## Getting Started
		- ### Installation
			- **Using uvx (recommended)**:
				- ~~~bash
				  uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena start-mcp-server
				  ~~~
			- **For Claude Code**:
				- ~~~bash
				  claude mcp add serena
				  ~~~
			- **Local development**:
				- ~~~bash
				  git clone https://github.com/oraios/serena
				  cd serena
				  uv run serena start-mcp-server
				  ~~~
		- ### Usage
			- Activate your project: Tell the AI "Activate the project /path/to/my_project"
			- For larger projects, index first: `serena project index`
			- Tools become available to the AI for semantic code operations
