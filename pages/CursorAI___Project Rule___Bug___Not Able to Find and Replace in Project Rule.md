- Currently, when editing a `.mdc` file stored in `cursor/rules`, [[VSCode/Docs/Editor/Code Basics/Find and Replace]] / [[VSCode/Editor/Find and Replace]] does not work.
- ## Update
	- this *has* been working for me a few times; I'm not quite sure what the issue was
- ## Workaround
	- use [[VSCode/Command/Search/Find in Files]]
	- use [[VSCode/Command/Search/Replace in Files]]
		- use the "Only in Open Editors" feature of [[VSCode/Search/and Replace]]
