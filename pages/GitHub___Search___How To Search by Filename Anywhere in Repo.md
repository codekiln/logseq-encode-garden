tags:: Search

- According to this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59910592/78202)
	- According to GitHub's help page on [Searching Code](https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-code), under [Considerations for code search](https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-code#considerations-for-code-search), it is mentioned that:
	- > Except with `filename` searches, you must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for `language:javascript` is not valid, while `amazing language:javascript` is.
	- So, just searching for `extension:feature` will not work. You need to use at least one search term. For example, `Feature extension:feature`, where `Feature` is a search term.
	- You can also search by language, by using, for example, `Feature language:Gherkin`.
