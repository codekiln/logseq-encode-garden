- # AICC â€“ Aviation Industry [[CBT]] Committee
  - Formed in 1988 by the aviation industry to develop standards for Computer-Based Training (CBT).
  - Developed early interoperability standards so training content could be used across different systems, especially in regulated environments (like pilot training).
  - Created the AICC CMI specification, a precursor to [[SCORM]].
  - Although originally aviation-focused, their work laid the foundation for broader e-learning interoperability.
  - Dissolved in 2014, with work transitioning to newer standards like [[cmi5]], intended as AICC's modern successor.
