	- ## Description
		- The symbolic abstraction of origin, motion of circle, and the reflection of evolution can be implemented in numerous forms and timespans and can inspire provocative insights into everyday life. Four custom-made controllers of two sizes are used for the performance. Each controller can be performed individually or together with the other three, creating an immersive musical experience.
