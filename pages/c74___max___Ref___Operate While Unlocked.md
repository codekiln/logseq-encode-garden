	- Operate While Unlocked mode allows you to adjust user interface objects while you are patching.
	- When a patcher is in Operate While Unlocked mode, the button in the Patcher toolbar will be highlighted.
	- Since clicking on user interface objects no longer selects them, you have to utilize other actions, including the following:
	- Shift+click will select an individual object.
	- Clicking on the border of an object will select it.
	- You can select one or more objects by mouse-dragging over them.
	- To perform actions with UI objects that require the option key, hold down the option and command keys.
