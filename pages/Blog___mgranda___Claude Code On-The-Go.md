- # [Claude Code On-The-Go - granda](https://granda.org/en/2026/01/02/claude-code-on-the-go/)
	- ## Key Insight
		- Running six [[Claude Code]] agents in parallel from a phone using Termius on iOS and a cloud VM
		- No laptop or desktop needed—just Termius on iOS and a cloud VM
		- The loop: kick off a task, pocket the phone, get notified when Claude needs input. Async development from anywhere.
	- ## Infrastructure
		- A Vultr VM in Silicon Valley:
			- Instance: vhf-8c-32gb
			- Cost: $0.29/hr (~$7 per day when running)
			- Pay only when working. Two scripts handle lifecycle:
				- `vm-start`: Starts the VM, waits for Tailscale, and connects via mosh
				- `vm-stop`: Halts the VM
		- iOS Shortcut that calls the Vultr API directly—start the VM from phone before even opening Termius
		- The VM's public IP has no SSH listener. All access goes through Tailscale's private network. Defense in depth: cloud firewall blocks everything except Tailscale coordination, local nftables as backup
	- ## Mobile Terminal
		- Termius handles SSH and mosh on iOS/Android
		- Mosh is the key—it survives network transitions. Switch from WiFi to cellular, walk through a dead zone, put the phone to sleep. The connection persists
		- One gotcha: mosh doesn't forward SSH agent. For git operations that need GitHub auth, use regular SSH inside tmux
	- ## Session Persistence
		- The shell auto-attaches to tmux on login. Close Termius, reopen hours later, everything's still there
		- Multiple Claude agents run in parallel windows. C-a c for new window, C-a n to cycle. Works well on a phone keyboard
	- ## Push Notifications
		- This is what makes mobile development practical. Without notifications, you'd constantly check the terminal. With them, you can walk away
		- The hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
			- When Claude calls AskUserQuestion, the hook fires. A simple script extracts the question and POSTs to Poke's webhook
		- Phone buzzes. Notifications show the question. Tap, respond, continue
	- ## Trust Model
		- Run Claude Code in permissive mode. The VM is isolated—no access to production systems, no secrets beyond what's needed for development. Worst case: Claude does something unexpected on a disposable VM
		- Cost control adds another layer. The VM costs $0.29/hr. Even if something runs away, the daily cap is bounded
	- ## Parallel Development
		- Git worktrees let me run multiple features simultaneously:
			- Each worktree gets its own tmux window with a Claude agent. Port allocation is hash-based—deterministic from branch name, no conflicts
		- Six agents, six features, one phone
	- ## What This Enables
		- Review PRs while waiting for coffee. Kick off a refactor on the train. Fix a bug from the couch while watching TV
		- The pattern: start a task that will take Claude 10-20 minutes, do something else, get notified, respond, repeat. Development fits into the gaps of the day instead of requiring dedicated desk time
	- ## The Components
		- Vultr: Cloud VM ($0.29/hr, pay-per-use)
		- Tailscale: Private network, secure access
		- Termius: iOS/Android SSH client
		- mosh: Network-resilient shell
		- tmux: Session persistence
		- Poke: Push notifications via webhook
		- Claude Code: The actual work
	- ## Related
		- The setup took one Claude Code session to build—gave it my Vultr API key and access to gh, asked for a secure dev VM. Now I code from my phone
