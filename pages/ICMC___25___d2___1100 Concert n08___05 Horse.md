	- ## #Description
		- Horse is an interactive electronic music piece that integrates the pipa with neuroscience, using sound to depict the majesty and freedom of a galloping horse. The composition is divided into three sections, portraying the horseâ€™s power, motion, and liberation.
		  Section 1: Majestic Presence The piece opens with the deep and powerful tones of the pipa, evoking the image of a proud horse standing tall with strength and dignity. This section sets the foundation for the grandeur and spirit of the horse.
		  Section 2: Exhilarating Gallop The tempo accelerates suddenly as the pipa employs rapid tremolos and plucking techniques to mimic the sound of galloping hooves. This section captures the dynamic intensity of a horse racing across vast landscapes, creating an immersive sense of speed and movement.
		  Section 3: Echoing Serenity The melody gradually softens, blending the expressive pipa techniques with ethereal electronic sounds. It paints the image of a horse slowing its pace under the sunset, enveloped in a vast and profound landscape, leaving behind a lingering sense of tranquility and depth.
