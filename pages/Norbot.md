	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- well-timed critique of [[AI/Issue/Alignment]], [[AI/Security]] and the [[Irrational Exuberance]] of [[Techno-Optimism]]
		- hilarious commentary on the [[Aesthetics]] of [[GenAI]]; the hedges that Norbot creates are all square and even. Also, while constructing them, Norbot dangerously and obliviously comes close to injuring Grommit and others while working so rapidly.
