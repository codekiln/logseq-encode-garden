- # How To Compare a File with Another Branch in VS Code (GitLens)
	- ## Goal
		- View file differences between a file in your current branch and a file in another Git branch, similar to PyCharm’s *“Compare With Branch”* feature.
	- ## Preconditions
		- VS Code installed
		- Git repository initialized
		- [[VSCode/Extension/GitLens]]  installed
	- ## Procedure
		- ### 1. Enable Branches View in GitLens for the [[VSCode/Panel/Source Control]] Source Code panel
			- Open **Source Control panel** (`Ctrl+Shift+G` / `Cmd+Shift+G`).
			- Expand the **GitLens** section.
			- Click the **three dots (…) menu**.
			- Select **Detach Branches View**.
				- This makes “Branches” appear as its own section.

		- ### 2. Diff a Specific File with Another Branch
			- In the **Branches** view, locate your current branch
			- Click the disclosure triangle for `BRANCHNAME`
			- Click on the pencil icon in the entry `Compare BRANCHNAME`
			- Enter the branch name you wish to compare with
			- You should now see an entry underneath like `DDD files changed AAA additions (+), DDD deletions (-)`; click the disclosure triangle
			- Locate the specific file under the disclosure triangle you wish to compare, right click on it
			- Navigate to **Open Changes with → Open Changes with Working File**.
			- A side-by-side diff opens between your working copy and the file in the other branch.
		- ### 3. Diff All Files with Other Branch
			- Press on the `+/-` file button, which has the tooltip "Open All Changes as Working Tree"

	- ## Gripes
		- There's no way to bring over individual lines from one side of the diff to the other, the way there is in [[PyCharm]] or [[JetBrains]]
	- ## Troubleshooting
		- If Branches aren’t showing, check the GitLens menu → **Detach Branches View**.
	- ## References
		- Use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **GitLens: Compare with Branch** for a repo-wide compare.
