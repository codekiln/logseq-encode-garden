- # FOMO
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- 20:29
		- 20:30 love the mechanical keyboard typing sounds, rotating around me on this 10 channel system
		- 20:32 a bunch of descending phrases, with tickles of straws in 3-d space. Delicate sound stage.
		- 20:33 these tiny little grabbing sounds fight with bass rumples as  the flipping whipper rotates around us.
		- Not as calming as the others this evening, as one might expect from the name "FOMO" -
		- Very #Cool piece. Amazing.
		- The crowd loves it, too
