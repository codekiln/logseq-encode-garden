		- {{youtube-timestamp 2}} all right hey everybody I am here today to show off a new feature of cursor that I think is severely underrated and is actually pretty awesome and so I wanted to share uh exactly how I can use this new uh model context protocol mCP function to really turbocharge a lot of the the common features of cursor so I'll show you how to build this kind of Step by Step from the ground up and then I have an open source repo uh you guys can check that out and feel free to contribute add what you want um for it do whatever all right so first of all I want to say thanks I uh made my first video just threw it up on Reddit just for fun uh and uh really got some good responses and really appreciate uh all
		- {{youtube-timestamp 48}} of the uh feedback got a lot of good tips myself and I thought I'd make another video here um based on some of the feedback one person uh called out a interesting repo I did I did a video on this earlier this week I'm looking at this Devon cursor rules basically the idea is that you can use cursor rules to execute scripts and basically have this multi-agent kind of Devon like uh system uh just using the core cursor functionality now this idea is amazing I think it's really interesting one problem I have though is I wor wor that because we are loading up these cursor rules with all of these kind of agent meta instructions it's your agent's not going to know enough about your code
		- {{youtube-timestamp 99}} base and and to me my cursor rules are so key to getting really consistent results that I hate to um use it all for um a lot of these these instructions and things but I do think adding On Tools so they've got interesting tools screenshot search engine all this stuff web scraper um this is really useful right uh i' I've been if you saw my last video I do a lot of manual copying and pasting I'm using other tools and I'm doing a lot of things it'd be great if we get start to automate that now just uh I think it was last week maybe uh a week ago um cursor implemented uh a connector to the model context protocol so this is something that was made by anthropic as kind of an open uh reference for how to
		- {{youtube-timestamp 148}} provide uh external tools to any client uh so so an agent can basically go and start using a variety of custom tools and have a nice interface for using that
		- so I would say read through this this is a better description than what I gave
		- also a much better description than than what we have here for cursor
		- {{youtube-timestamp 196}} my repo or this video because uh let me show you guys it's it's actually extremely cool what you can do with this
		- this gives you a good starting point
		- this is the mCP server repo
		- 01 is really good 03 mini really good at {{youtube-timestamp 240}} understanding what mCP is you know you can
		- throw some docs in there and get a starting point and then you know took me some tweaks to kind of get this dialed in so I would recommend doing something like that but you can also just um you know clone this repo this works uh pretty cool uh first thing is your TS config
		- create this build and uh it's basically this `index.js` file is what you're going to point cursor to
		- this module resolution some of this stuff is a little bit non-standard
		- you know just copy this uh you'll be good to go okay so the starting point here is
		- {{youtube-timestamp 283}} you basically um use this model context protocol SDK
		- it's this `stdio.js` standard inout
		- you have two choices
			- 1 - you can either host this at a port and run a web server
			- 2 - you can just directly point it to some some JavaScript and make the calls that way
		- JS is a little bit easier approach you know
			- you can do it the other way too
		- basically what we do is we create This Server instance {{youtube-timestamp 317}}
		- then we Define our tools
		- if you guys have done tool calling before this should look very familiar
		- you put your name description and then the schema right
		- so this <?> schema you make sure ...that it will validate {{youtube-timestamp 328}} against this
		- it's really important actually you make the description as clear as possible
			- this is basically the interface that the cursor agent is going to see
			- **if you're not clear about what these things are, you're going to have a hard time**
			- because the agent's going to not know what to do with with your tools
		- I've got **three tools** I put together I'll show you
			- **I've got my screenshot tool**
				- I want to take in the URL to screenshot
				- I want the agent to basically say here's the URL I want you to go and and screenshot
				- you have a choice you can either give the full URL or you can {{youtube-timestamp 365}} just give a relative path in this case
				- because we're using [[localhost]] I'm doing it here
				- if you wanted to do this on like a preview Branch or staging like you could change this right it's nice thing about this you can really customize this as much as you want um and then the way I have this set up is because I couldn't really figure out how to send um you know the a binary over to cursor and have it uh included I'm not sure if that's possible or not if it is that'd be great um so I kind of cheated and basically said hey cursor agent you just find tell me where you want me to save this screenshot and I'll just save it there um so then you can basically look at it in your repo you can drag it
		- {{youtube-timestamp 400}} into the agent if you want to uh make changes
			- it's kind of a neat way to see some of these screenshots directly
			- I've got an architect so again
			- if you saw my last video
			- I did a lot of work
				- concatenating all my files
				- I had the whole repo
				- I wrote a description of the task
				- I had all these [[XML]] tags
					- I sent that off to you know [[OpenAI/Model/o3/Mini]] a really smart reasoning model
					- to get back the plan
					- this is **absolutely a best practice** to get the most out of the cursor agent
					- I find this works **really well**
						- but it's **a pain** to do all that
						- so this tool **does that automatically**
						- which is pretty neat
						- it's *not quite as effective* as from what I {{youtube-timestamp 439}} found
						- but ... it's a really really good starting point
							- and I think you could iterate on that
				- this last one is just a little trick from my buddy
				- [[git/diff]]s
					- he had been adding that to the end of his cursor agent calls
					- before he actually you know does a commit or a push {{youtube-timestamp 459}}
					- up to the actual GitHub repo, just runs a quick `git diff` and asks the agent to review it
						- give them any fixes
						- kind of a neat approach
						- you know *I actually I think this might be built*
							- I actually *don't use a lot of the `git` commands directly through cursor*
							- so correct me if I'm wrong here
		- {{youtube-timestamp 481}} so then we do all that stuff
		- very simple here
		- we're just calling in the request get some params to figure out what tool we need to run um you know we start this thing here again this is standard stuff I didn't write any of this uh this is from the docs um and I I won't worry too much about this but it just works okay um and then the the tools themselves are pretty straightforward uh we'll start with the screenshot tool um so basically uh you know we're we're using Puppeteer we Just Launch the browser we go to the page we take a screenshot and uh we write it to this uh whatever that file path is okay and then here's the interesting thing thing is is we return this back and then this is
		- {{youtube-timestamp 521}} basically another prompt that you were giving to the agent right so we're telling it hey we saved the screenshot here um but before you continue ask the user to drag and drop that into the agent window again this is kind of a hack because I couldn't actually get it in there um but you'll see here the agent you know you know should kind of say Hey Kevin do you want to pull this in and and talk about it was cool right uh you could say whatever you want it uh you could say never say that you whatever you want um just kind of helps guide the agent uh again this code review um this is very simple uh what do we have here you know we're just doing a ex you know executing this this command
		- {{youtube-timestamp 561}} G Command right uh no big deal but then um as the instructions we're basically saying review this diff and then if you find any issues just fix it okay no big deal um so pretty cool and then the architect I think this is where you start to get into what I think could be a really really interesting use case this is an area I want to explore more um I might do another video um if I go deep on this um for those who don't know actually I maintain uh an open source coding agent I've been working on it for about a year now um full-time on and off um still work in progress still some interesting things there cursor you know is doing a really great job uh with their and their whole approach um but
		- {{youtube-timestamp 601}} there's some interesting ideas in that in that repo and I want to start to pull some of those in and kind of use the best of the ideas I have from my uh repo uh and merge them with the excellent tools um that that uh we offer here uh or the cursor offers so again you can start to do very detailed prompts here this one's fairly straightforward um but you could really go deep here and make this um a really uh intricate prompt um but the cool thing here we can actually just call out um to 03 mini you can call it 01 whatever model you want uh do an open source thing whatever you want um and you know basically return that back uh and basically the The Prompt here is all about um expert software architect
		- {{youtube-timestamp 649}} uh outline the steps that an AI coding agent should take to complete or improve the code okay and then outp put a step-by-step plan again this very similar to the the instructions that I had uh in the other video but it just does this automatically and the neatest part about this is if you actually look at what we're asking for for this architect um we're asking for the code okay it's the concatenated code for one of more files so we can take advantage of cursor's really good search tools and treit and whatever they're doing to um you know go out and do rag or whatever it is uh to identify the files that are relevant to a certain task uh and send those over so this way I don't have to
		- {{youtube-timestamp 686}} send you know the entire repository over there uh and get this it will automatically find the relevant files send them over um pretty neat to see that in action okay um one minor thing I will add here and I'm not going to show this but um one of the limitations of This Server uh approach is you can't actually put uh environment variables like I had in M here it wasn't working um and it's just a it's a security thing it just didn't didn't want there's probably a good way to do it um I didn't dig too deeply in it instead I took the yellow of just just like um I'm pulling this in from my uh a keys. JS file so I've got my open AI key here uh you know get ignore it it's it's only here
		- {{youtube-timestamp 728}} locally I'm only using this tool local but this is definitely not production level code guys this is just an example of how this tool works and just kind of you know instead of calling the weather like show you what what you can do with this thing okay so let's let's take a look at this real quick I'm going to pull up um you know this is my actual one of the the projects I'm working on this internal tool um and uh yeah let's just go ahead and uh try one of the tools oh so first of all sorry let me let me do this let me show how to um add this in here so just go to cursor um sorry in the uh settings here okay go to the features and if you scroll down there's a section here this
		- {{youtube-timestamp 765}} is new um mCP servers okay so go in here um just put whatever name you want doesn't matter um the type uh do command not SSE okay um and then the command is basically you're just running this node I mean it's just a just is just that index.js file um you you got to run a build uh you know on the other side to actually you know types script compile get it to to this JS file once you do that um just point to it and you'll kind of know right away if it picked it up because it will show you the tools that are available here and if you make any changes just hit this uh refresh button ux is kind of bad here it's like did it work not work I think it works sometimes I had to kind of reset the tool it's a
		- {{youtube-timestamp 809}} work in progress I give the cursor team a lot of credit for adding this in but I think there's some improvements we can do but overall really cool first start okay so that's step one step two is and you don't have to do this but I think it's really helpful in your cursor rules um I added this tools section and I basically just uh explained what the tools do and when I wanted um cursor to actually call these these tools okay so in this case like if you make a change to the UI use a screenshot tool and show the changes right maybe that's useful we'll see I'll play with this and see what works um you know this one for a complex task use architect tool to get a plan uh and then after a task is
		- {{youtube-timestamp 847}} performed go ahead and use this code review to get a diff and look at it so um let's do this uh I'll do this I'll start with the code review first since it's right here um okay let's say so I'm on a branch here this is my rubric fix I don't I just made this up um and let's see here I am going to uh let's just make a typo here right I I don't know like let's just say uh there we go um save this uh and I have to change okay we'll try this is not going to work anyway we'll try this here um let's run commit and C review and I've been having this lately okay fine we'll submit okay okay so we run a bill check that's fine should work um I again these are part of my cursor rules I'm always asking to run
		- {{youtube-timestamp 907}} builds before it actually does any commits I find that's very helpful uh in Real World um coding um do I actually have okay fine it's G May okay maybe I'll fix this sorry I meant to make just a simple change okay yeah yeah yeah it's going to fix that okay oh it just fixed it you okay uh fine we'll run this build um maybe in the meantime let me see if I can just like save this here so that's not going to doesn't going to break anything let's see if um we'll see if the uh code review fixes uh and identifies that but in the meantime okay everything works it's fine let's accept this just to get those out of there so basically if you look at this the only change I've made is a bunch of ease uh build successful we're
		- {{youtube-timestamp 970}} going to commit this is fine okay so now we committed now let's see now uh okay here we go so it said let's perform a code review okay so when it calls a tool um it asks for the the um any kind of attributes because I need to know where this um is to run that that diff command um you know I'm asking for the folder path it's kind of a hack like I think there's probably better ways to actually do this thing um but uh you can see this okay and so in this case yeah change was forward and straight forward uh it didn't catch this thing with the example but this is just Tex so you know again I'm just kind of showing uh this this is um probably should have came up with a better example before I ran this
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1013}} but this works fine it's okay um so we have that there um let's do something else um and I'm just going to try to pull this um screenshot um uh do a screenshot of the logout screen let's try this again this is a little bit contrived normally um you know ideally you'd make some complex UI change and it would do a screenshot um and do this so I just want to show um exactly kind of how um the screenshot tool works it's kind of cool we did some work we found out exactly where that um route would be so we're calling it with this off signo and then we're basically saying save it to the screenshots logos screen.png okay okay there we go so it said hey we took a screenshot um there it is pretty cool uh you can
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1065}} drag and drop this in here if you want right so you can say uh make this look awesome right it'll do you know Cloud's actually pretty good about doing stuff like this um so again it knows what um where my uh where that actual component is uh it's able to make changes um you know you can make some changes here you screenshot it again it'll go back and forth um actually curious to see if it's going to go through and do another tool call um a new page yeah we don't need yeah that's fine okay but anyway um oh there it goes taking a screenshot of this new design this actually going to run actually I guess I guess this is running in the background I didn't know it was uh okay let's look at this
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1110}} uh it doesn't look any different okay anyway you get the idea here take a screenshot this is again contrived example but um me D that here uh and then what I really like is Let's uh go ahead and show um example of the plan if you saw my um thing last week we had all these instructions and this template all this XML and the cursor rules complicated thing um here we're just going to take this task it's a real bug I have actually I'm curious to see what it does um and so we're saying you know here's the here's the thing I want to do create a plan of fbox now I gave it instructions to um only do a plan when it's a really complicated thing this actually might be easy enough for a cursor to just kind of
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1150}} look at it and Sonic to be like you know what bro this is like a dumb bug I can just fix this myself without having to create a whole plan to do the thing which is exactly what you want right you want it to kind of self be self-aware to to say what it um can do and what it needs more of a of a plan to do um and what's cool here look at what it did so it went out there it uh did a search it grabbed the relevant files and then when it's doing this call basically we send the task and then you know we're basically sending over some code oh we're not actually sending a code it's interesting I've seen this most of the times it actually sends this uh this code over here so I'll probably need to
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1185}} adjust some some things um but uh let's see here okay I think what happened was uh the um so you can see here here's kind of the step byep of like what to do um analyze the data flow review this um check this out blah blah blah BL so it's got this whole um step-by-step approach um which is pretty cool uh again might need to tweak this a little bit again point of this I want to show you guys the power and potential of this uh mCP and and what you can do with it um I'm really excited about I think there's a lot of tools that that I personally will start to play with and and if you guys come up with cool stuff uh definitely let me know uh I would love to see see what you guys do maybe feature some of these
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1229}} all right and so you know if you guys want to play with this uh I've got this um up here um you know be careful with this it's not production code there might be bugs I'm probably not going to go through and and do a bunch of like support on this right this is more just for tutorial purposes show you guys how to build an mCP server um and if you guys find this interesting let me know um we love I'm going to keep doing some of these videos U having a lot of fun with this you guys seem to like it so I I appreciate all the all the support and all the great comments um so go a And subscribe subscribe I'll make some some more videos uh along this vein if you guys have ideas of things that you want
		- {{youtube-timestamp 1263}} to see or I've got a whole bunch of you know tricks in my bag that that I'm happy to share and show you guys kind of how I how I use this day today uh did some really cool stuff today actually earlier today with the Deep research um being able to use that and the the the super secret 03 model behind the scenes which is actually incredible at coding um so there's some tricks there uh and we got some new models kind of coming out soon I think Gemini is going to come out I can show uh an example of how I've used that in the past and and maybe do a quick review of of how that works so again you guys have content you want let me know uh otherwise I will see you guys later
