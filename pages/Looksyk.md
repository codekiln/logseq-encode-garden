			- > So, as a hobby, on a small scale: No whiteboard, no flashcards, and no blockchain-based AI assistant. Instead, it's a PKMS based on Markdown files on the hard drive with a wiki and a journal, queries (kept very simple), templates, a context assistant, and diverse file support.
			- > Thanks to [[Rust]], an in-memory data model, and a bit of optimization with Flamegraph, it's very fast even with larger graphs (where logseq became sluggish for me).
