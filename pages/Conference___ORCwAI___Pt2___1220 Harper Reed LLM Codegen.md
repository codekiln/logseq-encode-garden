	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- 12:30 this is definitely based on his recent blog posts
		- 12:30 [[AI/Coding/v0/File/TICKET-spec.mdc]] - keystone of entire process is the spec
			- if you don't have the spec it won't work
			- "lately it's gotten so good I don't even read them"
		- 12:31 feed spec into reasoning model, and have it generate the prompts
		- 12:32 [[Greenfield Coding]] loop
		- 12:32 "Context packing"
			- mentions repo2txt
			- one test at a time, one feature at a time
			- do a new branch - use it like a video game checkpoint
			- he mentions pre-commit [[Py/Lib]] [[CICD/CI]] on every commit
			- `git reset --hard` every four hours
			- 12:33 "Waterfall" is no longer evil
			- LLM needs clear specs
			- "the micro-cycle is waterfall"
				- you can do it concurrently
		- 12:35 no more jobs we can recognize
			- general de-skilling
		- 12:36 pro tips
			- start plain
			- scaffolds keep models honest
			- short prompts beat essays
		- 12:38 closing remarks
		- 12:46 some one mentions this
