		- The [[Security/Model]] here leaves a lot to be desired - there's no indication of what type of data would like to be accessed by the app or what is being accessed. Presumably, the client application would like to utilize some MacOS system service provided by the [[1Password/Desktop]] app, but that's not clear at all; 1Password doesn't appear anywhere in the dialog.
	- ## Dialog contents - "<APP_NAME> Access Request"
