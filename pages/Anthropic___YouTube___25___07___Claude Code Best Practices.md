	- ## [[My Notes]]
	  id:: 688e2332-502a-4106-aa81-ddeb8aed57cc
		- Nice reminder of [[Agentic]] definition from [[Anthropic/Blog/24/12/Building Effective Agents]]
			- ((688e1ee0-8a38-4879-a2f1-6aad419c8020))
		- It's interesting to hear how skeptical he sounds of [[MCP]] use in Claude Code at this time; it sounds "advanced" and he advises that people prefer well-documented [[CLI/Tool]]s over MCP Servers
			- {{embed ((688e1ee0-c23d-408c-8541-e7ef92b40df3))}}
		- I don't think I've managed to use the [[AI/Image/Processing]] features of [[Claude Code]] yet

			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 5}} Introduction and Personal Background
				- #### Welcome and Overview
					- "Welcome everyone to Claude Code best practices"
					- Talk structure:
						- High-level overview of what Claude Code is
						- Understanding how it works under the hood
						- Good use cases and best practices
				- #### Personal Introduction
					- Cal's background:
						- Joined Anthropic about a year and a half ago
						- Part of the Applied AI team
						- Mission: help customers build great products on top of Claude
						- Spends time prompting Claude for optimal outputs
					- #### Coding Background
						- Self-described coder who starts many projects but rarely finishes
						- Has a "graveyard of code" from unfinished projects
						- Always spinning up new ideas
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 64}} Discovery of Claude Code
				- #### Initial Encounter
					- Heard about new tool in Slack
					- Downloaded on a Friday night
					- Applied to a new notetaking app project
				- #### Transformative Experience
					- "That whole weekend just kind of totally changed the way that I code and think about software engineering"
					- Carried laptop around all weekend
					- "Super addicted to just watching Claude Code work"
					- Watched powerful application come together in real-time
					- Got much further than would have on own
				- #### Internal Recognition
					- Worried about token usage
					- Claude Code team had internal leaderboard tracking usage
					- Shot to the top over the weekend
					- Met Boris and Cat from early Claude Code team
					- Became core contributor focusing on:
						- System prompts
						- Tool descriptions and results
						- Evaluation methodology
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 154}} What is Claude Code?
				- #### Mental Model
					- "Claude Code is like that co-worker that does everything on the terminal"
					- Never touches GUI, terminal whiz
					- Like having a mentor (Tony) next to you all the time
				- #### Technical Architecture
					- **Pure agent approach**: instructions + powerful tools + model runs in loop
					  id:: 688e1ee0-8a38-4879-a2f1-6aad419c8020
					- Tools include:
						- File creation and editing
						- Terminal usage
						- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
					- **No indexing approach**: Claude explores codebase like a new team member
					- Uses same search tools humans use: glob, grep, find
					- **Agentic search**: model can do searches, analyze results, then search more
				- #### UI and Security Features
					- Light UI layer showing Claude's work in real-time
					- Permission system for dangerous operations
					- Security focus with lightweight architecture
					- Easy integration with AWS and GCP cloud providers
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 366}} Use Cases for Claude Code
				- #### Discovery and Onboarding
					- Supercharges onboarding into new codebases
					- Ask "where is this feature implemented?"
					- Analyze git history and code evolution
				- #### Thought Partnership
					- Use as planning partner before diving into work
					- Ask for multiple implementation options
					- Validate approaches before starting
				- #### Code Building and Writing
					- **Zero to one projects**: build apps from empty directory
					- **Existing codebases**: primary focus area
					- High unit test coverage due to ease of adding tests
					- Great commit and PR messages
				- #### Deployment and Lifecycle
					- Use Claude Code SDK for headless automation
					- Integrate into CI/CD pipelines
					- GitHub Actions integration
				- #### Support and Scale
					- Faster debugging
					- Large codebase migrations (Java version upgrades, PHP to React)
					- CLI tool expertise (Git, Docker, BigQuery)
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 617}} Best Practices
				- #### Use Claude.md Files
					- {{youtube-timestamp 655}} Claude Code doesn't really have [[AI/Memory]]
					- Main way to share state across sessions
					- Plopped into context when Claude Code starts
					- Can be placed in:
						- Project directory (shared with team) {{youtube-timestamp 688}}
						- Home directory (personal preferences)
					- Include information like:
						- How to run unit tests
						- Project layout overview
						- Style guides
						- Module locations
				- #### Permission Management {{youtube-timestamp 725}}
					- Read actions allowed automatically
					- Write/run commands require permission
					- **Autoaccept mode**: Shift+Tab for automatic approval [[Keyshort]]
					- Configure specific command approvals in settings - `npm run test` for example
				- #### Integration Setup {{youtube-timestamp 786}}
					- Leverage CLI tools (GitHub's `gh` tool)
					- Install [[MCP/Server]]s for custom tools
					  id:: 688e1ee0-c23d-408c-8541-e7ef92b40df3
						- Best Practice #Tip: Prefer well-documented [[CLI/Tool]] over MCP servers
					- Document internal tools in `Claude.md`
				- #### Context Management
					- Context builds up over time (200,000 token limit) {{youtube-timestamp 861}}
					- Options when context fills up:
						- `/clear`: start over (preserves Claude.md)
						- `/compact`: summarize and continue {{youtube-timestamp 895}}
					- Compact functionality tuned for efficient continuation
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 873}} Efficient Workflows
				- #### Planning and To-Dos
					- Ask for plans before implementation {{youtube-timestamp 926}}
					- > "Can you search around, figure out what's causing it, and tell me a plan?"
						- you can verify what claude's going to do
					- Watch to-do lists and intervene if needed
						- Press Escape to modify plans mid-execution
				- #### Smart Iterative Coding {{youtube-timestamp 970}}
					- Test-driven development approach {{youtube-timestamp 982}}
					- Small changes with test runs
					- Check TypeScript and linting
					- Commit regularly for fallback points
				- #### Screenshot Guidance {{youtube-timestamp 1000}}
				  id:: 688e1ee0-cf83-4625-88a8-c3a8ead1e454
					- Use screenshots for visual guidance
					- Paste images or reference image files
					- "Look at this `mock.png` and build the website"
				- #### Advanced Techniques {{youtube-timestamp 1035}}
					- **Multiple Claude instances**: run 2-4 simultaneously
					- Use [[tmux]] or different tabs
						- > I can only do 2, but I know people who can do four {{youtube-timestamp 1050}} #Quote
					- **Escape key mastery**: stop and interject when needed
					- #Tip Double escape: jump back in conversation {{youtube-timestamp 1083}}
					- [[MCP Server]]: for advanced tool integration
						- *hear him be a bit hesitant about this*
					- **Headless automation**: programmatic Claude usage
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 1115}} New Features and Updates
				- #### Model Selection
					- `/model` command to see current model
					- Switch between Sonnet and Opus
					- `/config` for configuration changes {{youtube-timestamp 1154}}
				- #### Enhanced Thinking {{youtube-timestamp 1177}} #Tip
					- "Think hard" or extended thinking capabilities - you should specify it
					- > {{youtube-timestamp 1185}} Starting with [[Anthropic/Model/Claude/4]] Models now think between tool calls [[AI/Model/Reasoning]]
						- Visible as lighter gray text
						- Encouraged for complex tasks and bug solving
				- #### [[IDE]] Integrations {{youtube-timestamp 1228}}
					- [[VSCode]] VS Code and [[JetBrains]] integrations
						- Claude knows what file you have open
						- Enhanced development workflow
				- #### Staying Updated about new things in [[Claude Code]] {{youtube-timestamp 1261}}
					- #Tip
						- Public GitHub project: Claude Code under Anthropic
						- **Check changelog weekly**
							- Fast shipping pace
							- > "Even I can't keep up with it"
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 1293}} Q&A Session
				- #### Multiple Claude.md Files {{youtube-timestamp 1300}}
					- Can have multiple files in different directories
					- Only reads Claude.md in current working directory by default
					- Encourages Claude to read relevant files in subdirectories {{youtube-timestamp 1330}}
						- Can reference other files with @ symbol in `Claude.md`
					- Example: `@package.json`
				- #### [[Anthropic/App/Claude Code/Claude.md]] Effectiveness - Why doesn't it work? {{youtube-timestamp 1372}}
					- > I have not had luck having Claude honor Claude.md, for example, inline comments #Quote -- Claude User
						- Model behavior issues (excessive commenting) mostly fixed in Claude 4
						- Better instruction following in newer models
						- Good time to review and update `Claude.md` files
				- #### Multi-Agent Execution {{youtube-timestamp 1460}}
					- question: can we have agents that use each other's context?
					- Currently single agent approach
					- Future: shared markdown files for agent communication
					- Manual orchestration through file-based state sharing
				- #### Closing
					- Claude Code stickers available
					- Happy to answer questions and do live demos
