		- 11:38 compelling soundscape - I mean [[To Listen Again]]. We have at least four channels here, I didn't realize yesterday
		- space changes in jump cuts
		- fields of blurs - clocks, whirring, more of the deep bass pulsing in and out
		- the stage is dimmed with purple and pink light, ... is this the color of electronic music?

	- ## #Description
		- The work presents itself as an allegory of the concept of conflict, understood in its most intimate sense. A descent into the abyss of discord, where acoustic entities battle for supremacy. There is no redemption, only blind fury, untamed and unyielding, that moves toward the destruction of the other. What remains is pure silence.
		- The entire composition employs ==concrete samples of percussion, metal objects, and sine wave frequencies==.
		- Signal processing techniques include time-stretching and [[Synthesis/Granular]]. The concrete samples processed with granular synthesis were broken down into tiny fragments through manual editing and then reassembled with a new temporal order through a kind of micro-editing.
