	- A classic book about **how things are made**, and how **quality** emerges from a process—not just from "design" or "materials."
	- ## Core Concept: Workmanship as Risk
		- Pye defines workmanship as the **degree of risk** in the making:
		- ### Workmanship of Certainty
			- The process is set up so the outcome is essentially guaranteed.
			- Examples:
				- Injection molding
				- CNC machining
				- Stamping
				- Mass production jigs/fixtures
		- ### Workmanship of Risk
			- The quality depends on the maker's real-time judgment and skill—failure is always possible.
			- Examples:
				- Hand carving
				- Turning
				- Hand planing
				- Freehand joinery
	- ## Why It Matters
		- Pye argues that "craft" is not about romance or tradition—it's about **where the risk sits**:
			- You can have *risk* in modern processes (e.g., a skilled operator dialing in a machine)
			- You can have *certainty* even in "handmade" work if it's heavily constrained by templates/jigs
			- "Mass production" isn't inherently lower quality; it's a different strategy for managing risk
	- ## The Takeaway Heuristic
		- If you want higher quality, you either:
			- Reduce risk by constraining the process (**certainty**)
			- Accept risk and pay for skill/time (**risk**)
	- ## Connections
		- Related to software engineering concepts:
			- CI/CD = certainty
			- Type systems = certainty
			- Codegen = certainty
			- "Guardrails" = certainty vs "hero coding" = risk
