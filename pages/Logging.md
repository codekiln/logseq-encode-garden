			- > In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), **logging** is the act of keeping a [log](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/log#Etymology_2) of [events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(computing)) that occur in a computer system, such as problems, errors or broad information on current operations. These events may occur in the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) or in other [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software). A message or *log entry* is recorded for each such event. These log messages can then be used to monitor and understand the operation of the system, to [debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging) problems, or during an [audit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit). Logging is particularly important in [multi-user software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_software), to have a central overview of the operation of the system.
