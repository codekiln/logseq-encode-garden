		- Both **more context** and **more tools** degrade agent performance
		- Agents that require longer trajectories degrade more quickly
		- #o1, #o3-mini, and #[[Claude 3.5 Sonnet]] are comparable and in a different league than #4o and [[Meta/AI/Model/llama/3.3-70B]]
		- #[[o3-mini]] performs as well as #[[o1]] and #[[Claude 3.5 Sonnet]] with smaller context, **but sees a steeper performance drop as context grows**
