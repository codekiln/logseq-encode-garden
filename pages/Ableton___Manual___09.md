	- > When you first load a sample into Live, Live automatically analyzes the audio and finds its transients. **These are the points in the audio where notes or events begin, and are usually good places to put Warp Markers**. Transients appear as small markers at the top of the Sample Editor after zooming in.

	- > **As you mouse over transients, temporary “pseudo“ Warp Markers appear**. These have the same shape as regular Warp Markers, but **they’re gray**.
	- > **Double-clicking or dragging a pseudo Warp Marker creates an actual Warp Marker** or, if there are no Warp Markers later in the clip, changes the tempo for the clip segment

	- > Think of a sample as a rubber-band that you want to pin to a (musical time) ruler. In Live, the pins are called Warp Markers. **An [[Ableton/Warp/Marker]]** locks a specific point in the sample to a specific place in the measure. You can use any number of Warp Markers to create an arbitrary mapping of the piece’s inherent rhythm to a musical meter.
		- > They can then be dragged or moved with the arrow keys to different points in time. Warp Markers can also be deleted by double-clicking them, or by pressing the computer keyboard’s [Backspace] or [Delete] key after selecting them.
