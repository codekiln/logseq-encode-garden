			- ## 2025-05-08 – O'Reilly AI Codecon – Craig McLuckie – Tipping AI Code Generation on its Side
				- ### Talk Overview
					- **Speaker**: Craig McLuckie
					- **Length**: 5 minutes (Lightning Talk)
					- **Time**: 13:24 ET
					- **Theme**: Moving from closed, vertically integrated AI tooling to open, horizontally composable systems
				- ### Slide: Vertically Integrated AI Stacks
					- Visual shows 3 identical vertical stacks, each labeled **App** at the top.
						- Each stack contains:
							- **Workflow Logic**
							- **Context Management**
							- **LLM**
					- Represents current architecture where every AI tool builds its own full vertical system.
						- This leads to duplication of infrastructure across apps.
				- ### AI Summary
					- Craig McLuckie critiques the prevailing model of AI code generation, where each product builds an end-to-end vertical stack—including its own LLM, context manager, and workflow engine.
					- These **vertically integrated stacks** are closed systems that inhibit interoperability, innovation, and reuse.
					- He argues that the next evolution must tip this structure **horizontally**, enabling shared context management and LLM resources across different applications.
					- This shift mirrors earlier evolutions in tech (e.g. microservices, containerization) that replaced monolithic systems with more **modular, composable architectures**.
					- Emphasizes the importance of **community-led efforts** and open standards—like the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**—to facilitate this transition.

				- ### Slide Summary
					- **Title Slide**
						- "Techniques for Getting High-Quality Code from LLMs"
					- **Slide: Prompt Engineering is a Core Dev Skill**
						- LLMs are now tools in every developer’s toolbox.
						- Prompt engineering is as fundamental as learning a framework.
					- **Slide: Architecture-First Prompting**
						- Begin prompts with high-level architecture and design goals.
						- Helps guide LLMs to generate code that fits into existing systems.
						- Example prompt: “I’m building a Flask app with this structure…”
					- **Slide: Contextual Scaffolding**
						- Provide surrounding code context to situate the LLM.
						- Use file headers, imports, docstrings, and nearby function calls.
						- Helps the LLM understand naming conventions and system patterns.
					- **Slide: Task-Specific Prompting**
						- Customize prompts for:
							- New feature development
							- Debugging
							- Refactoring
						- Example: For debugging, provide error trace and expected behavior.
					- **Slide: Progressive Enhancement**
						- Start with a minimal viable prompt.
						- Add detail iteratively to refine the output.
						- Encourages experimentation and layered improvement.
					- **Slide: Collaborate, Don’t Delegate**
						- Treat the LLM like a junior developer:
							- Guide it.
							- Review output.
							- Improve over time.
						- Emphasizes the importance of human review and iteration.
				- ### AI Summary
					- Patty O’Callaghan presents a set of practical strategies for getting consistently strong output from LLMs in software engineering tasks.
					- Key idea: don’t expect magic—**collaborate** with the model by designing thoughtful prompts.
					- Strong prompts lead to **better alignment** with existing systems and more maintainable code.
					- Encourages iterative development of prompts, tailored to both the task and the architecture.
