			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 0}} Introduction & Overview
				- Presenter introduces the topic: **5 Claude Code commands you may not know about**
				- Expresses enthusiasm for Claude Code and its usefulness
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 13}} use it yeah kind of all the time if I have something I want to do. So yeah, I'm just going to go through some different commands I use. uh yeah to help me save some time sometimes and it could be easier if you wanted to dive
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 27}} Command 1: Setting Up `claude.md` (Project Rules)
				- Use `/init` to create a `claude.md` file for project guidance
				- Example rules for `claude.md`:
					- 1. Always write secure, best-practice Python code
					- 2. Write and execute tests for each function; iterate based on results
					- 3. Delete test scripts if tests pass
					- 4. Commit after each new function
				- Demonstrates editing `claude.md` and connecting to GitHub via MCP server
				- Shows workflow: create repo, add rules, test automation (write, test, commit, clean up)
				- **Key Insight:** Setting up `claude.md` saves time and enforces best practices
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 40}} example of how we can use this claw MD file today. And yeah, just going to do something simple and I'm going to show you kind of how this works and how we can use this for our uh advantage. So this is the cloud MD file I want to use
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 54}} today. Uh yeah, you can see here I kind of prepare this but you can you do this manually, right? So uh do you want to create cloud MD? Yes, I do. And then I'm going to edit it manually. So this is going to be placed here in my folder.
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 67}} Now you can see this in cursor. So we can go into this. So this is basically rules you can set for your project. So this file provides guidance to cloud code, right? Uh we have a project overview and yeah this was just
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 82}} something from my previous uh project. So I'm going to remove all this and I'm going to do like a custom cloud MD here for my next project. So an example of this could be let's update our cloud. So number one, we must always write secure
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 95}} best practice Python code. Two, always write tests for each function we create and execute the tests. Iterate the function based on the test results. Delete test scripts if the test passes. And number four is always commit after
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 108}} each new function is added to our codebase. So this is what we are going to update our cloud MD file with. And hopefully now cloud code will always follow these simple rules when we actually uh do some changes to our codebase.
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 124}} Okay. So here we have it. So this is kind of our rules to follow. Now, uh, we're going to do one more thing before we test this out. And you can see we have connected our GitHub here in an MCP server. So, I'm just going to create a
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 136}} new repo for our test project. So, let's just create this repo and we're going to use our MCP to do that. Or we're going to use GitHub tools. Okay, that's good. So, we're probably going to just create this. Yeah, now it's done. Let me check. Yeah,
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 150}} you can see we have our project here in GitHub. That's good. So what I want to do now is I want to add this to my cloud MD file. So just add this to our project repo in cloud MD. Okay, good. So you can see we have our repo here now. Perfect.
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 163}} So now we can actually test this out. So let's do write an email input validator function in CC.py. So we're not going to instruct this to test this now. Write test for it. But this because this should be in our markdown file cloud MD,
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 177}} right? So let's see what happens now if we create a CC.py PI with an email input validator. Hopefully now it will look in this and create the tests we need, right? So you can see CC. Okay. So yeah. Okay. Perfect. We created
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 195}} the CC.py. So now I want to see if we create a test for this. Yes. Test CC.py. So this is going to import this probably. Yes. Okay. And hopefully we will execute this test. Uh yes. Okay. So those were okay. Now I want to see if we
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 211}} delete this test remove. Yeah. Okay. So you can see how this follows our cloud MD and this is very helpful sometimes. Right now we want to do this to add this to our repo. Okay. So let's have a look. So if you refresh here now you can see
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 226}} we have our CC.py here. Perfect. So that worked right. This is already tested. Should be good to go. Uh but we can add to this right. Okay. The next step is to add a date input validator field in CC.py. So let's try that. Hopefully this
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 244}} should be the same. It should do everything we said in our cloud MD. So we should write uh function test it and uh commit it. Yes, we're going to add the function. Yes, we're going to write the test. We're going to run the test.
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 258}} All good. We're going to remove the test. Perfect. We're going to update our GitHub to commit this. And that was it. Right. So if you refresh here now, you can see we added our validate uh function. So that was easy. So this is a
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 275}} very nice way to work. I kind of like this workflow. So spending some time setting up your claw MD could be helpful even in like small project like this. Now we have two functions that is tested. Not maybe terribly tested, but
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 288}} at least some tests have been run on this. So that is kind of the first command. Setting up your claw MD file. This could be helpful sometimes, not every time, but yeah, check it out. So, let's move on to our second command. Uh,
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 301}} I sometimes like to use. Another thing we can do is actually create this uh custom commands. This could be project or global. So, we can create a global one here. So, just to create this file in this uh cloud commands folder. So,
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 316}} let's just do that. Uh, I prepared some of these. So, one I use sometimes is Yeah, we can just do this. one I use is um uh a file called claw docs.md. So this is kind of a command file that kind of points to where I have
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 333}} stored my claw documentation. So I kind of can update this. This is some information about uh yeah how to use the claw AI API. So this is the file I refer to in cloud code to kind of look up documentation so I can show you how this
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 348}} works. So yeah, we can just create this file and you will see this file now ends up in my commands file along with the other ones I have here, right? Uh but let me show you how this works now. So if you do slash you can see we have
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 360}} these different user commands here. So let's do use uh let's say we can do user and we can do let's do claude docs right and I can do a question behind here. Give me a code example of claude AI API. So this will now look in the file I have
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 378}} pointed to here, right? Uh hopefully. Yeah, you can see it's going to look in my claw docs file. So this is kind of pre-arranged. So now it kind of has all the documentation from this MD file here and we should pick up that uh how to
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 395}} create a a call chat or like a client message create call to claude or anthropic is this. Right? So now we can bring this into context and it's a very easy way to yeah use documentation you already have stored locally if you
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 411}} wanted to do that. So we can just follow up create a simple test for this and now we already have the context here. Right. And it should be super easy to fix now. Yes. Right. And we can check this out. And here we have everything. We just
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 425}} need to import anropic set our API key and we are kind of ready to try this out. Right. So this is something I try out all the time. Try to just uh refer to my kind of documentation. I have one for OpenAI just to save some time. Uh so
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 442}} this could be useful. This could be anything. You can customize the way you work, right? So yeah, I kind of like this command. Doesn't use it all the time, but sometimes instead of going to uh OpenAI's uh documentation, I just use
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 457}} this simple command here. But there's also something that is almost as fast if not faster if you're already on the page. So what we can do if you didn't know, we can use images in cloud code. So let's say uh yeah, I just wanted to
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 472}} do a quick call to let's say OpenAI. Uh I just need some simple Yeah, we can do a Python here, right? So I can just screenshot this, right? Um for some reason I tried to copy this but I couldn't make it work. But we can just
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 486}} save this right into our images. So we can just drag the image in here and explain this and let's see what happens. So you can see this is clearly working. We can take this a step further, right? We can screenshot this. Something like
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 501}} this. Drop it in here. Extract the text please. And there we have it. Right? And you can follow up. Write a Python code to add all the Roman numbers and come up with a final conclusion. Let's just try that and see if we can do that. Okay. So
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 518}} you can see here uh here we have the article text. We extracted some Roman numbers and the sum is 27 as integral. Can't confirm, can't deny. But yeah, that is just something you can do by using images in cloud code. Right?
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 535}} Another simple thing you can do is uh you don't have to run uh everything in like an interactive mode here. So we can do oneshot mode by using the -ashp command and a query for quick commands. So you can see an example here. We can
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 550}} actually do cloudp what does this function do and this would just uh answer this single command and exit. Uh but we can pipe content into this. So this is like specific context. So you can do cat maybe lo.ext and kind of
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 564}} analyze this error. So this will only focus on this one particular file combined with the query. So I can show you kind of quickly how that works. So if I grab the path to my OpenAI documentation here and if I go back to
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 579}} let's say uh yeah we can just go back here and what I can do is do cat right do this we can do this and we can do claw dashp and then we can do our query what model uh are we using here. So now we specifically just going
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 600}} to look in this file here, right? You can see we're going to read this file. So this is just if you want to do like one simple command. So it read all of this. And you can see we are looking at the GPT4.1 model in this case. And we just
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 615}} exit. We don't continue here. So this was just to look in this specific file we pointed to here in our command here using the col functioner. So this is something also can be useful if you have a lot of files here and you only want to
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 630}} look in just one of them, not the full context. This could save you some time and maybe some uh some yeah tokens just to save some money because cloud code is already expensive. So sometimes I just use this if I know that uh what I'm
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 645}} looking for is in this specific file then I can save some time by just using this quick-p command and kind of referring to a specific file in my yeah codebase. Another thing we can do is uh just do claw-p and do let's say create a
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 662}} list of my currency rates data set. So this could be 10 uh and we do d- output- format and we set our format. This could be JSON. So this if we run this now this is probably just going to look up to create this data set here and the output
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 677}} format we specified you can see here is going to be JSON currency JSON and we have 10 different currencies. Uh yes I want to create that and this is something you can always do just do this uh output format command here to get
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 693}} yeah kind of the format you want. So this is also something that can be very helpful if you have like a specific yeah output you want to use. We can update this to get real-time information too if you wanted to. So this is something I
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 706}} use if I know exactly if I want like a special output format. Uh we can do this in another format too if we yeah we can try that. So let's do XML. Yeah, you see this works. So this is also something I recommend uh if you haven't tried it
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 723}} out. could be very helpful if you have some specific use cases that fits uh maybe what you're creating. So if you do prompts, I recommend setting this up using output format in XML or you can just specify it. But yeah, uh that
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 741}} workshpput format command. The final thing I wanted to look at is extended thinking. So this is me it's not specified in cloud code but they recommend that you can use the kind of the prompt think about or think harder about. So you kind of just have to
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 759}} specify this and you can ask kind of clo think up deeply about I think we're going to try think deeply about uh so let's try to do that and see what kind of changes if we use that command in cloud code. So let's try think deeply
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 774}} about a step-by-step plan to calculate arbitrage trading from our currency rates.json data set. So let's see what happens now uh if we do this uh think deeply command uh we probably won't see the thinking tokens but uh maybe we use
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 790}} more time but let's see now. Okay so I'll create a plan and thinking so this is what I wanted to see. So if you didn't know about this uh this is something you can try out. So just use kind of the think deeply about and we
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 806}} will get this tinking tokens here. So yeah I've tested this out and kind of doing like an initial plan. This could be good for this but let's uh let this run out. You can see we're going to implement the Bellman Ford algorithm to
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 820}} detect negative cycles, calculate potential profit, calculate functions. Yes. So, I'm going to let this run out. We're going to run it one time to see what we end up with here. Okay. So, we're going to follow the instructions.
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 833}} So, we're going to do a pip install here and let's run it. Okay. So, we have an error. So, we want to fix that. Okay. So, it ran. So, we we did not find any arbitrage opportunities, but we created an exchange graph. So, if we take a look
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 850}} here, this is what we created, right? So, oo that was hard. So, this is some kind of graph to kind of look at some arbitrage opportunities, but uh unfortunately I don't think we found any. So, we're going to try to do a demo here, I
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 868}} think. Let's try it again. Okay. So, just as a demo here, you can see we find a 4% profit. So, we can open up this. We found a 4% profit opportunity here between Euro, USD, British pounds, and euro again. Uh, so that was pretty funny. So, let's
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 887}} take a look at how this looks. You can see this is kind of marked out here in green, I guess. Right. And maybe in red here. So, that was pretty cool. So, yeah, just some things you can do using the thinking command. And basically,
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 903}} that's what I wanted to cover today. I just wanted to go over code and do maybe some things that could gave you some inspiration how you can use this. Uh, like I said, I don't use all this all the time, but uh, I really like to use
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 916}} the claude MD if I'm going to I'm know I'm going to work in a project. So, it can kind of follow my rules. So, I don't kind of save some input tokens on that. And, um, -p just to save some tokens on kind of looking into one specific file,
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 932}} you know, about is also something I like. Images is always good. So yeah, hope you learned something, gave you some ideas, some inspiration, and I'll see you again very
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 903}} Conclusion & Takeaways
