			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 0}} Introduction & Overview
				- "Today I want to go over five different commands you probably haven't used yet in Claude Code."
				- Presenter is a big fan of Claude Code and uses it frequently.
				- The video will demonstrate commands that save time and make working with Claude Code easier.
				- Claude Code is used for automating tasks, saving time, and improving workflow.
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 27}} Command 1: Project Rules with `claude.md`
				- Use `/init` to create a `claude.md` file for project guidance.
				- Example rules for `claude.md`:
					- 1. Always write secure, best-practice Python code
					- 2. Write and execute tests for each function; iterate based on results
					- 3. Delete test scripts if tests pass
					- 4. Commit after each new function
				- Demonstrates editing `claude.md` and connecting to GitHub via MCP server.
				- Shows workflow:
					- Create a new repo for the project
					- Add rules to `claude.md`
					- Test automation: write, test, commit, clean up
				- Example workflow:
					- Write an email input validator function in `CC.py`
					- Claude Code automatically writes a test, runs it, and deletes the test if it passes
					- Commits the changes to GitHub
					- Repeat for additional functions (e.g., date input validator)
				- Using `claude.md` ensures best practices are followed and saves time on repetitive tasks
				- [[Key Insight]]: Setting up `claude.md` enforces best practices and automates much of the coding workflow
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 288}} Command 2: Custom Command Files & Documentation Lookup
				- Create custom command files (project or global) to store frequently used commands or documentation.
				- Example: `claude docs.md` for storing API documentation.
				- Use user commands to query documentation files directly (e.g., "Give me a code example of Claude AI API").
				- Claude Code fetches relevant info from the referenced file, making it easy to access documentation without leaving the editor.
				- #Example: Using a custom docs file to answer API questions quickly.
				- **Tip:** Store API docs locally for quick reference and efficiency.
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 457}} Command 3: Using Images in Claude Code
				- Drag and drop images (e.g., screenshots) into Claude Code to extract text and use it as context.
				- Example: Screenshot code, extract text, and ask Claude to write [[Py]] code based on it.
				- Useful for extracting data from images for further processing or coding tasks.
				- Claude can process images, extract relevant information, and help automate workflows.
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 535}} Command 4: One-Shot Mode & File-Specific Queries
				- Use `-p` (oneshot mode) for single commands and quick queries.
				- Pipe file content into Claude Code for focused analysis (e.g., `cat file.txt | claude -p 'What model is used here?'`).
				- Saves tokens and time by narrowing context to a specific file.
				- [[Key Insight]]: Use oneshot mode for targeted, efficient queries and to save on compute costs.
			- ### {{youtube-timestamp 662}} Command 5: Output Formatting & Extended Thinking, Conclusion
				- Use `output-format` to specify result format (e.g., JSON, XML) for Claude's output.
				- Example: Generate a currency rates dataset in JSON or XML.
				- Extended thinking: Use prompts like "think deeply about" for more thorough, step-by-step plans.
				- Example: Ask Claude to "think deeply about a step-by-step plan to calculate arbitrage trading from currency rates.json"; Claude generates a plan, implements algorithms (e.g., Bellman-Ford), and analyzes results.
				- [[Key Insight]]: Prompting for deeper thinking can yield more comprehensive solutions.
				- Recap of favorite commands: `claude.md` for project rules, `-p` for file-specific queries, images for context, output formatting, and extended thinking.
