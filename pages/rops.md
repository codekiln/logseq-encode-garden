- # [[rops]]
	- ## Overview
		- Alternative to [[sops]] specifically designed for teams using [[AWS/KMS]]
		- Rust implementation focusing on AWS integration
	- ## Key Features
		- ### AWS Integration
			- Native [[AWS/KMS]] support
			- [[AWS/IAM]] role-based access control
			- Region-specific encryption
		- ### File Format Support
			- [[yaml]] - YAML configuration files
			- [[json]] - JSON data files
			- [[EnvVar/.env]] - Environment variable files
	- ## Use Cases
		- Team-based secret management in AWS environments
		- [[CICD]] pipeline secret management
		- Infrastructure as Code secret handling
	- ## Integration Considerations
		- Can be used with [[mise]] through command execution
		- Alternative to [[sops]] when [[AWS/KMS]] is the primary encryption method
		- Works well with version control systems
