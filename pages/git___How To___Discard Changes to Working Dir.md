- # How to Discard Changes to Working Directory with Git
	- ## Overview
		- This guide shows you how to safely discard unwanted changes in your Git working directory
		- Useful when you want to abandon local modifications and return to a known good state
	- ## Prerequisites
		- Git installed on your system
		- A Git repository with changes you want to discard
		- Basic understanding of Git staging area and commits
	- ## Steps
		- ### 1. Review Changes to be Discarded
			- Run `git status` to see what changes will be discarded
			- Make sure you really want to discard these changes (they cannot be recovered!)
		- ### 2. Choose Your Discard Method
			- #### Option A: Discard All Changes (Staged and Unstaged) - [[git/reset/--hard]]
				- Run `git reset --hard HEAD`
				- This discards all changes and returns to the last commit
			- #### Option B: Discard Only Unstaged Changes - [[git/checkout]]
				- For all unstaged changes:
					- Run `git checkout -- .`
				- For specific files:
					- Run `git checkout -- path/to/file`
			- #### Option C: Discard Only Staged Changes - [[git/reset]]
				- First unstage the changes:
					- Run `git reset HEAD`
				- Then follow Option B if you want to discard them completely
	- ## Safety Measures
		- ### Before Discarding
			- Create a backup branch if unsure:
				- Run `git branch backup-YYYY-MM-DD`
			- Or stash your changes:
				- Run `git stash save "description of changes"`
	- ## Troubleshooting
		- ### Common Issues
			- If you accidentally discarded changes:
				- Check `git reflog` for recovery options
				- Restore from stash if you created one: `git stash pop`
			- If some files aren't being discarded:
				- Check if they're being tracked by Git
				- For untracked files, use `git clean -f`
