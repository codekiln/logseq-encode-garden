- # Technique - convert multiple formats to [[Markdown]] for use with a [[LLMs]]
	- ## Impetus
		- Similar to [[PDF/Tool/CLI/PDF To Markdown Tools]], I wanted a tool that could work with [[pptx]], [[docx]], as well as [[PDF]]. Ideally,
	- ## [[ChatGPT/Deep Research/Query]]
		- ## Problem Space Summary
			- ### Context:
				- You are exploring solutions for a colleague, who needs to:
				- Convert a directory and all its recursive subdirectories containing PDFs, DOCX (Word), and PPTX (PowerPoint) files into text-based formats (specifically Markdown).
				- Prepare these converted files to be easily ingested by GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering and content querying.
			- ### Key Requirements:
				- The conversion process should **handle multiple document types**: PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx).
				- Files should be **recursively processed** within nested directories.
				- Output should ideally be Markdown, optimized and structured appropriately for LLM ingestion.
				- Optionally (nice-to-have), the solution would **extract images from PDFs** and generate descriptive **alt text** for accessibility and improved context. This alt text should be integrated into the Markdown output.
				- Markdown files should be concise, potentially consolidated for easier use with GPT-based systems.
			- ### Tools Already Considered:
				- You've mentioned examples similar to:
				- **RepoMix**
				- **GetIngest**
			- ### Additional Context from Attached Documents:
				- You have provided [[PDF/Tool/CLI/PDF To Markdown Tools]]
					- This document includes your deep research into various CLI-based tools that specifically focus on converting PDFs to Markdown. It highlights multiple tools you've evaluated, each with strengths and weaknesses. These tools primarily focus on PDFs and vary in their support for images, metadata, and formatting fidelity.
		- ## Next Steps for Deep Research:
			- Based on this summarized context, the deep research task should explore solutions that provide:
			- A comprehensive, automated workflow capable of processing entire directory structures filled with mixed document types (PDF, DOCX, PPTX).
			- Solutions or combinations of tools that can efficiently handle conversions to Markdown, including potential image extraction and automatic alt-text generation.
			- Workflow or pipeline suggestions integrating directly with GPT or LLM ingestion platforms.
			- ### Desired Output from Deep Research:
				- The deep research should yield:
					- **Evaluation of existing tools** (including the ones you've already identified, like RepoMix or GetIngest, and others emerging from the deep research).
					- Recommendations on either single tools or combinations of tools that best meet your requirements.
					- Brief summaries of capabilities, ease of integration, and gaps identified during the evaluation.
					- Suggested workflow architecture or steps that clearly describe the process from input (mixed directories) to output (GPT-ready Markdown).
	- ## [[ChatGPT/Deep Research/Response]]
		- ### Intro
			- Converting a directory of mixed-format documents (PDFs, Word DOCX, PowerPoint PPTX, etc.) into a unified **Markdown** corpus can greatly streamline ingestion into GPT-based Large Language Models. Markdown is lightweight, human-readable, and preserves document structure (headings, lists, tables, etc.), which helps LLMs maintain context and hierarchy​[medium.com](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/improved-rag-document-processing-with-markdown-426a2e0dd82b#:~:text=Markdown%20is%20a%20lightweight%2C%20easy,md%20files)​, [medium.com](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/improved-rag-document-processing-with-markdown-426a2e0dd82b#:~:text=Markdown%20has%20some%20important%20advantages%2C,1). However, achieving *high-quality, structured Markdown* from diverse file types in bulk is challenging. Tools need to handle recursive directory traversal, preserve formatting and images, and even condense or clean boilerplate text. Recent open-source solutions – inspired by the idea of packaging content (similarly to how RepoMix bundles entire codebases) – have emerged to automate this conversion. This report examines leading tools and workflows that meet the requirements, comparing their features, pros/cons, and ideal use cases. We focus on free and open-source options, with one notable paid solution included for contrast.
		- ## Options with Pros and Cons
			- ## Docling (IBM Open Source)
				- **Docling** is an open-source Python library from IBM designed to *“parse popular document formats, including PDFs, DOCX, and PPTX, with high speed and ease”*​[medium.com](https://medium.com/@onur.sakar1997/document-processing-and-query-automation-with-ibm-docling-converting-to-markdown-and-json-with-4f318257669a#:~:text=Docling%20is%20an%20IBM%20library,information%20retrieval%20and%20RAG%20applications). It offers advanced document understanding and outputs well-formatted Markdown or JSON. Docling can be used via a simple CLI or as a Python API.
				- *Features:* Docling supports PDF, Word, PowerPoint, plus images, HTML, AsciiDoc, Markdown, and even Excel (XLSX)​[github.com](https://github.com/docling-project/docling#:~:text=,play%20integrations%20incl.%20LangChain). It performs layout analysis (identifying headings, multi-column reading order, tables, code blocks, etc.) and has OCR for scanned documents​[github.com](https://github.com/docling-project/docling#:~:text=,play%20integrations%20incl.%20LangChain). The output retains structure with proper Markdown syntax (e.g. `#` headings for titles) and can include metadata. It also provides a unified internal representation (the “DoclingDocument”) for further processing​[github.com](https://github.com/docling-project/docling#:~:text=,Various%20export%20formats%20and%20options). Notably, Docling integrates with retrieval frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex for downstream Q&A or RAG pipelines​[github.com](https://github.com/docling-project/docling#:~:text=including%20Markdown%2C%20HTML%2C%20and%20lossless,Simple%20and%20convenient%20CLI). It runs fully locally (no external API required) and is MIT-licensed.
				- **Pros:**
					- Comprehensive format support (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, etc.) in one tool​[medium.com](https://medium.com/@onur.sakar1997/document-processing-and-query-automation-with-ibm-docling-converting-to-markdown-and-json-with-4f318257669a#:~:text=Docling%20is%20an%20IBM%20library,information%20retrieval%20and%20RAG%20applications).
					- Outputs clean Markdown or JSON without manual intervention​[medium.com](https://medium.com/@onur.sakar1997/document-processing-and-query-automation-with-ibm-docling-converting-to-markdown-and-json-with-4f318257669a#:~:text=Docling%20is%20an%20IBM%20library,information%20retrieval%20and%20RAG%20applications).
					- Advanced parsing of layout (headings, tables, reading order) for accurate structure​[github.com](https://github.com/docling-project/docling#:~:text=,play%20integrations%20incl.%20LangChain).
					- Built-in OCR for scanned PDFs, and support for visual models (e.g. image classification with “SmolDocling”) to handle images​[github.com](https://github.com/docling-project/docling#:~:text=,play%20integrations%20incl.%20LangChain).
					- Simple CLI usage (`pip install docling` then `docling <input>`). Can batch-process multiple files via scripting or its `DocumentConverter.convert_all` method (examples are provided for folder conversion).
					- Lightweight dependencies compared to heavy ML frameworks; purely local execution for privacy​[github.com](https://github.com/docling-project/docling#:~:text=,play%20integrations%20incl.%20LangChain).
				- **Cons:**
					- CLI processes one file or a single input source at a time (no one-liner for entire directory in current version). Recursive processing requires a small script or loop to call the converter on each file.
					- Image handling is basic out-of-the-box (extracts images but doesn’t auto-caption them). The “image classification” feature can label images, but generating descriptive alt text may require additional steps or the VLM pipeline.
					- Being a relatively new project (launched late 2024), it’s under active development – some advanced features (metadata extraction, charts, etc.) are marked “coming soon”​[github.com](https://github.com/docling-project/docling#:~:text=Coming%20soon). Minor bugs may exist as it matures.
				- **Ideal Use:** Docling is ideal for users who want an **all-in-one, local solution** to convert a collection of documents for LLM ingestion without setting up heavy AI models. It’s especially useful if you plan to integrate with RAG pipelines (since it plays nicely with LangChain/LlamaIndex) or need to handle a variety of formats consistently. For example, you could point Docling at a directory of reports and quickly get structured Markdown files for each, complete with headings, lists, and tables preserved. If you need image captioning or extra refinements, you can extend it with its plugin/VLM system, though that requires more configuration. Overall, Docling provides a **balanced, easy-to-use workflow** covering the core needs (format support, structure, OCR) in an open and extensible package​[medium.com](https://medium.com/@onur.sakar1997/document-processing-and-query-automation-with-ibm-docling-converting-to-markdown-and-json-with-4f318257669a#:~:text=Docling%20is%20an%20IBM%20library,information%20retrieval%20and%20RAG%20applications)​[github.com](https://github.com/docling-project/docling#:~:text=,play%20integrations%20incl.%20LangChain).
			- ## MarkItDown (Microsoft)
				- **MarkItDown** is an open-source CLI and Python tool from Microsoft that **converts various file formats into Markdown** for AI applications​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=Markdown%20has%20become%20a%20ubiquitous,Microsoft%20that%20simplifies%20this%20process). It emphasizes ease of use and broad format coverage, making it a versatile choice for preparing documents for LLM consumption. The design philosophy is to bridge *“structured or unstructured data and a clean Markdown representation”*, especially to feed LLM pipelines​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=Markdown%20has%20become%20a%20ubiquitous,Microsoft%20that%20simplifies%20this%20process).
				- *Features:* MarkItDown supports **all key formats**: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, as well as Excel spreadsheets, HTML, images, audio (transcription), and more​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=Supported%20Formats)​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=,Markdown%20tables). It uses optional dependencies to enable each format (e.g. `pip install markitdown[pdf,docx,pptx]` for those three)​[github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown#:~:text=pip%20install%20markitdown). By default it extracts text and structure: for PDFs it parses layout and text; for Word and PowerPoint, it uses their structure to output equivalent Markdown (headings, bullet points for slides, etc.)​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=,structure%20from%20PDF%20documents). MarkItDown also handles images: it can extract images and (with an AI helper) generate alt-text captions. Uniquely, it has a **plugin system** and can integrate cloud AI services: for example, you can enable an Azure Document Intelligence plugin for higher-fidelity parsing​[github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown#:~:text=Azure%20Document%20Intelligence), or provide an OpenAI API client to generate image descriptions​[github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown#:~:text=To%20use%20Large%20Language%20Models,llm_model). The tool can be run via command-line on single files or even entire ZIP archives (it will iterate through archive contents converting each file)​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=,Markdown%20tables). It’s distributed under MIT License and can be installed via pip (`markitdown[all]`).
				- **Pros:**
					- Wide range of supported formats beyond just PDF/DOCX/PPTX (e.g. HTML, images, CSV/JSON to Markdown), which is useful if your directory has mixed content​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=Supported%20Formats)​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=,Markdown%20tables).
					- Simple CLI usage: `markitdown input.docx -o output.md` writes Markdown, and it can be easily scripted for batch processing. (It doesn’t natively traverse folders, but using shell scripts or converting a folder to a zip are workable solutions since it supports ZIP input​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=,OCR%29%20for%20text%20extraction).)
					- Clean Markdown output that preserves structure – headings, lists, tables, links, etc., with minimal extra markup. It was designed for LLM-friendly output, so boilerplate is minimal.
					- **Image handling:** Extracts images and (if desired) calls an LLM to insert `![alt text](image.png)` with generated alt descriptions​[github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown#:~:text=To%20use%20Large%20Language%20Models,llm_model). This means you can automatically get captions for figures by providing an OpenAI key (it defaults to using GPT-4 Vision if available)​[github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown#:~:text=To%20use%20Large%20Language%20Models,llm_model).
					- **Extensible:** The plugin architecture allows integrating advanced parsing or external services. For instance, enabling the Azure Document Intelligence plugin (`-d` flag with endpoint) uses Microsoft’s cloud AI to analyze the document and return *very accurate Markdown*, including complex tables recognition​[github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown#:~:text=Azure%20Document%20Intelligence). This gives a quality boost on tricky PDFs (at the cost of API usage).
					- Lightweight installation for basic use – it uses Python libraries for format conversion (like PyMuPDF for PDFs, python-docx, python-pptx, etc.), so no huge ML model downloads are required unless you opt into those.
				- **Cons:**
					- Does not automatically recurse through nested directories. You’ll need to script a loop or use the ZIP trick for bulk processing (e.g., zip a folder and let MarkItDown unpack it)​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=,OCR%29%20for%20text%20extraction). This is a minor inconvenience rather than a limitation, but out-of-the-box it’s one-file-at-a-time.
					- By default, it relies on deterministic parsing which may not capture complex PDF layouts as perfectly as an ML-based approach. Very complex multi-column PDFs or those with lots of floating text might need the Azure AI mode to get perfect structure.
					- The optional features (Azure integration, GPT image captioning) require API keys and can incur costs, which adds setup overhead. If you don’t use those, image alt-text will be just placeholders or file names, and extremely complex tables might be output as raw text.
					- Being a new project (released in late 2024), it’s still gaining traction. It’s stable, but the community is smaller compared to more established tools. Documentation is solid but primarily in the README.
				- **Ideal Use:** MarkItDown is excellent for **quickly converting a variety of documents** when you need a straightforward tool that “just works.” If your directory contains not only PDFs but also some `.pptx` presentations, spreadsheets, and images, MarkItDown can handle all of them in one sweep​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=Supported%20Formats)​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=,Markdown%20tables). It’s a great choice for a user with basic coding skills: for example, you could write a short Bash or Python script to loop over all files in a folder and call `markitdown` on each, or use it interactively for individual files. Moreover, if you later require higher fidelity on certain files (say a very complicated PDF or the need for alt-text on diagrams), you have the option to flip on the Azure AI analysis or hook in an LLM – effectively **scaling from a simple local tool to an AI-enhanced pipeline as needed**. This flexibility makes MarkItDown a robust choice for preparing datasets for LLM ingestion, from lecture slides to PDFs and beyond​[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/markitdown-powerful-tool-converting-data-markdown-llm-nik-bear-brown-zsnle#:~:text=Markdown%20has%20become%20a%20ubiquitous,Microsoft%20that%20simplifies%20this%20process).
			- ## Marker (Datalab’s “Marker” by Vik Paruchuri)
				- **Marker** is a powerful open-source tool that prioritizes **accuracy** in converting documents to Markdown (and JSON/HTML) using advanced machine learning. It was developed by Vik Paruchuri and the Datalab team, and has quickly become known for handling extremely complex documents (academic papers, technical reports, etc.) with high fidelity. Marker uses a pipeline of deep learning models for layout analysis, OCR, table detection, math rendering, etc., and can optionally leverage an LLM for even better results​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=Marker%20converts%20documents%20to%20markdown%2C,and%20HTML%20quickly%20and%20accurately)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=,on%20GPU%2C%20CPU%2C%20or%20MPS).
				- *Features:* Marker supports **PDF, DOCX, PPTX** along with images (including scanned PDFs via OCR), Excel (XLSX), HTML, and EPUB ebooks​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=Marker%20converts%20documents%20to%20markdown%2C,and%20HTML%20quickly%20and%20accurately). It strives to preserve all elements: headings, **tables, forms, equations, inline math, references, and even code blocks** in the Markdown output​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=Marker%20converts%20documents%20to%20markdown%2C,and%20HTML%20quickly%20and%20accurately)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=,on%20GPU%2C%20CPU%2C%20or%20MPS). It will extract images to separate files and insert `![image](file.png)` references​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=Marker%20converts%20documents%20to%20markdown%2C,and%20HTML%20quickly%20and%20accurately)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=,on%20GPU%2C%20CPU%2C%20or%20MPS). Uniquely, Marker attempts to remove clutter like headers/footers or duplicated page elements, yielding cleaner text​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=,on%20GPU%2C%20CPU%2C%20or%20MPS). It has an optional *“Hybrid mode”* (`--use_llm` flag) where it calls a connected LLM (by default a local Gemini model) to refine the output – e.g. merging table cells across page breaks, improving math notation, and generating descriptions for images​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=Marker%20converts%20documents%20to%20markdown%2C,and%20HTML%20quickly%20and%20accurately)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=%2A%20%60,in%20the%20document%20and%20re). Marker is designed for speed through parallelism: you can run it on multiple files with `--workers`, and even distribute across multiple GPUs for large batches​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=Convert%20multiple%20files)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=NUM_DEVICES%3D4%20NUM_WORKERS%3D15%20marker_chunk_convert%20). It requires Python 3.10+ and PyTorch, and installs via pip (`pip install marker-pdf[full]`). The code is open-source (GPL-3.0 license), with model weights under a non-commercial license (free for personal/research use).
				- **Pros:**
					- Arguably the **most accurate conversion** for complex layouts. Marker’s deep learning pipeline is state-of-the-art, built specifically to retain structures that simpler parsers miss (e.g. multi-page tables, mathematical formulas with LaTeX syntax, footnotes)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=Marker%20converts%20documents%20to%20markdown%2C,and%20HTML%20quickly%20and%20accurately)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=,on%20GPU%2C%20CPU%2C%20or%20MPS). This makes it ideal for academic or scientific documents.
					- Supports all required formats and more, including tricky ones like scanned images/PDFs and output to multiple formats (Markdown or structured JSON). It uses a high-quality OCR (the *“Surya”* OCR toolkit) for scanning text, supporting many languages​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=0%2C%205%20through%2010%2C%20and,processors)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=%2A%20%60,only%20extract%20and%20convert%20tables).
					- **Image and figure handling:** By default, it saves images and references them in the Markdown. If you enable the LLM mode and disable image extraction, it will replace each image with an AI-generated description in the Markdown​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=%2A%20%60,in%20the%20document%20and%20re) – automatically giving you alt text (this uses the connected LLM, so it requires an API key for the Gemini model or similar).
					- Highly configurable: dozens of command-line options to fine-tune processing (e.g. force OCR on all pages, process only certain page ranges, adjust how math is handled)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=%2A%20%60,additional%20logging%20and%20diagnostic%20information)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=%2A%20%60,%28default%29%20or). Advanced users can tweak the pipeline or even provide custom model stages.
					- **Batch processing and recursion:** Marker can take a directory as input (`marker /path/to/folder`) and will recursively process all files in it (and its subdirectories) by default​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=Convert%20multiple%20files). This meets the requirement of processing entire directories. With the `--workers` flag, it parallelizes the work across CPU/GPU cores​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=Convert%20multiple%20files), making it feasible to convert large document sets quickly (the author reports ~15 seconds for a 250-page PDF on powerful hardware)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=,convert%20a%20250%20page%20PDF)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=There%27s%20a%20hosted%20API%20for,marker%20available%20here).
					- Strong community and ongoing development. Marker gained a lot of attention (thousands of GitHub stars) and the developer is active in improving it. There’s also a hosted API service available if one prefers not to run it locally​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=Hosted%20API).
				- **Cons:**
					- **Heavy setup:** Marker’s sophistication comes at the cost of complexity. You need a compatible GPU (or at least a fast CPU) and must install PyTorch and download model weights. On a CPU-only machine, it can run but will be slow for large documents. The full install (with `[full]` extras) is a larger footprint compared to lighter tools.
					- The licensing is restrictive for commercial use (GPL for code, and model weights are CC BY-NC-SA). This is fine for personal or educational use (which is the assumed scenario here), but organizations may need to negotiate a commercial license with the author​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=development%2Ftraining%20costs,some%20restrictions%20on%20commercial%20usage).
					- Resource usage is high: parallel processing can consume a lot of RAM/VRAM (the docs note ~5GB VRAM per GPU worker at peak)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=,5GB%20average)​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=%2A%20%60,5GB%20average). One should tune `--workers` according to available hardware to avoid out-of-memory issues.
					- Not as straightforward to use for novices. While basic usage (`marker_single file.pdf`) is simple, interpreting the myriad of options can be daunting. Also, if something goes wrong (e.g. model not found or unsupported GPU), the error messages might require some ML background to troubleshoot.
					- The focus is on accuracy over brevity: Marker will output very detailed Markdown, which is great for fidelity but might be verbose. For LLM ingestion, you might still need to chunk or summarize the output if the documents are very large (Marker itself doesn’t condense content beyond removing obvious redundancy like repeated headers).
				- **Ideal Use:** Marker shines for **research papers, technical documents, or any material where preserving complex structure is paramount**. If your directory is full of scientific PDFs with equations, or multi-level corporate PDFs with complicated formatting, Marker will likely produce the closest Markdown reproduction (where headings, subheadings, tables, equations, references are all properly formatted). It’s the go-to when other simpler tools fall short on accuracy. For instance, if Docling or MarkItDown output a mangled table or miss a two-column layout, Marker can handle it thanks to its vision-based approach​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=Marker%20converts%20documents%20to%20markdown%2C,and%20HTML%20quickly%20and%20accurately). The trade-off is setup and performance – so it’s recommended if you have **GPU resources and need the fidelity**. For a user in a Python AI course, Marker could also be a learning experience, showcasing how multimodal models assist document parsing. In summary, use Marker for high-stakes conversions like a **repository of academic papers to Markdown**, where you intend to feed an LLM with rich content (and possibly even have the LLM read the alt-text of figures generated by Marker’s LLM integration) for tasks like literature review or code generation assistance.
			- ## MinerU (OpenDataLab’s MinerU)
				- **MinerU** is another advanced open-source project that converts documents to Markdown and JSON, originating from the team behind the InternLM large model. It was **“born during the pre-training process of InternLM”**, meaning it was developed to prepare high-quality text datasets (including scientific literature with symbols) for LLM training​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=markdown%2C%20JSON,known). MinerU is similar in spirit to Marker – using a combination of vision models and OCR to handle complex layouts – and it supports all three target formats among others.
				- *Features:* MinerU supports **PDF (scanned or digital)**, Word (.doc & .docx), PowerPoint (.ppt & .pptx), and images (JPEG, PNG) as inputs​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=%2A%20For%20the%20data,new%20Stages%20according%20to%20their). It provides a staged processing pipeline (with configurable “Stages”) where each stage handles a task like layout detection, text extraction, table recognition, etc., and these can be customized or extended​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=currently%20supports%20a%20variety%20of,customize%20their%20data%20processing%20workflows). It outputs structured data in multiple formats, notably **“multimodal Markdown”** (which likely includes text plus placeholders for images or special tokens) and JSON with reading order preserved​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=,efficient%20confirmation%20of%20output%20quality). Key capabilities include advanced table extraction (they integrated models like RapidTable for faster table processing), and formula recognition – MinerU puts special focus on converting scientific formulas correctly into Markdown (potentially using LaTeX syntax)​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=,%2A%20Parsing%20effect%20optimization)​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=,net%2F%2097%20huggingface%20huggingfa). Like Marker, it uses deep learning models (e.g., a YOLO-based layout model for page segmentation, a Unet model for formulas​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=,restructuring%20the%20processing%20pipeline%2C%20overall)​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=,%2A%20Parsing%20effect%20optimization)). It also provides visualization tools to verify the layout detected, which is useful for developers. MinerU can be used via a Python API – for example, it has a `Dataset` class to load a folder of documents and process them in bulk through defined stages​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=%2A%20For%20the%20data,new%20Stages%20according%20to%20their). The project is licensed AGPL-3.0 (very open but requires derivative works to also open-source).
				- **Pros:**
					- Designed with **LLM data preparation in mind** – it explicitly focuses on preserving content for AI ingestion, handling tricky parts like mathematical symbols and tables, which is crucial for technical documents​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=markdown%2C%20JSON,known)​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=,efficient%20confirmation%20of%20output%20quality). If your content is scientific, MinerU’s attention to formula conversion is a plus.
					- Batch processing is a first-class feature. You can point MinerU at a directory or use its `Dataset` abstraction to iterate through many files easily​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=%2A%20For%20the%20data,new%20Stages%20according%20to%20their). This satisfies recursive directory conversion, and you can define a custom workflow for all files (e.g., parse all PDFs with certain settings in one go).
					- Strong table extraction and structure preservation. The use of specialized table recognition models means output Markdown tables are likely to be accurate, even for complex or rotated tables​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=parsing.%20,Integrated%20RapidTable%20for%20table)​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=,to%20use%20layoutreader%20for%20reading).
					- Extensible pipeline: advanced users can modify or add processing stages if needed (for example, inserting a summarization stage could be possible given the design, though that’s not built-in). This modular design is powerful for custom workflows or integrating additional post-processing (like consolidation or filtering of content).
					- Up-to-date development with optimization: the team has continuously improved speed (50%+ faster in recent versions)​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=,headings%2C%20thereby%20enhancing%20document%20structuring) and even supports acceleration on AI hardware like Huawei Ascend NPUs​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=,parsing%20will%20automatically%20select%20the). This means it’s scaling to handle large volumes efficiently (assuming you have the hardware).
				- **Cons:**
					- **Complex setup and dependencies:** MinerU is a heavy-weight solution. It requires multiple model downloads (for layout, OCR, formula parsing, etc.) and a suitable environment (PyTorch or another deep learning backend). Documentation is partly in Chinese (the repo has both English and Chinese notes), so English-only users might need to rely on translations or community help for certain advanced configurations.
					- The license (AGPL) can be a concern if you ever want to use it in a closed-source project. It effectively forces any modifications to be open-sourced. For personal or academic use this is fine, but it’s a consideration.
					- Not as straightforward for one-off use. There isn’t a simple single-command CLI like the others. You typically write a short Python script using MinerU’s API to perform the conversion workflow you want. This offers flexibility, but for a user with only basic Python knowledge, it’s a bit more involved than running a CLI tool. (However, given that the user here is taking a Python AI course, using a Python API might be acceptable.)
					- Similar to Marker, it’s resource-intensive. To get the benefit of its accuracy and speed, a good GPU is recommended. Running on CPU could be slow for large docs.
					- Currently, the focus is on PDFs and Office docs; if you need other formats like HTML or EPUB, it’s not clear if those are supported in MinerU (the core list is more limited than MarkItDown/Marker in terms of input types). Also, generating nicely consolidated Markdown might require tweaking — e.g., ensuring that the “multimodal Markdown” output is what you need for LLMs (likely yes, since that is one of their outputs).
				- **Ideal Use:** MinerU is well-suited for **large-scale document conversion projects**, especially in research or industrial settings where the documents contain complex content (scientific papers, technical manuals, patent documents with formulas/diagrams) and you plan to feed this content into LLMs. If you were creating a knowledge base for an LLM out of thousands of academic papers, MinerU’s heritage (born from LLM pre-training needs) makes it a top candidate. It’s also a good choice if you want to script a **custom workflow** – for example, converting documents to Markdown and then automatically chunking or indexing them – because its pipeline can be customized in Python. For individual users with smaller document sets, MinerU might be overkill compared to Docling or MarkItDown. But for a power user aiming to **maximize accuracy and willing to script** a bit, MinerU provides cutting-edge capabilities in the open-source realm (comparable in output quality to Marker). In summary, use MinerU when you need a **research-grade solution** and don’t mind a bit of extra setup to ensure every formula and table in your document directory is perfectly represented in Markdown​[github.com](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU#:~:text=,efficient%20confirmation%20of%20output%20quality).

		- ## Workflow Recommendations and Best Practices
			- Choosing a tool depends on your specific needs and resources. Here are some scenarios and recommendations:
			- **For most users with a mix of documents and a desire for simplicity:** Start with an open-source CLI tool like **Docling or MarkItDown**. Both are easy to install and require minimal configuration to get good results on PDF, Word, and PowerPoint files. For example, if you have a “Docs” folder containing various `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.pptx` files, you can use a few lines of Python (or a shell script) to loop through each file and run MarkItDown or Docling conversion. This will yield a collection of Markdown files, preserving headings, paragraphs, and lists in a consistent format. These Markdown files can then be directly ingested by an LLM (either via concatenation, chunking, or indexing for retrieval). If you need to **condense or summarize** the content (to fit context length), you can feed the Markdown into an LLM afterwards to generate summaries. Neither Docling nor MarkItDown perform automatic summarization or chunking on their own – they aim for faithful full conversion – so a common workflow is *“convert then summarize/index”*. The output from these tools is clean enough that a summarizing LLM can easily parse it.
			- **Including images and figures:** If your documents have important images (like charts in a PPT or figures in a PDF), and you want your LLM to get context from them, consider using **MarkItDown with an OpenAI key** or **Marker’s LLM mode** to generate alt-text. For instance, MarkItDown can call GPT-4 to describe an image it extracted​[github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown#:~:text=To%20use%20Large%20Language%20Models,llm_model), inserting that description in the Markdown. Marker with `--use_llm` will do something similar using the Gemini model​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=%2A%20%60,in%20the%20document%20and%20re). This way, even though the LLM you’re using to ingest the Markdown might not see the image itself, it will read the descriptive caption and gain some understanding of the visual content. If you prefer not to use any API for this, you could run an offline captioning model or simply write a placeholder alt text and later manually or semi-manually fill it in. The key is that all these tools give you hooks to ensure images are not lost in the conversion.
			- **When maximum fidelity is required (complex layouts):** Use **Marker or MinerU**. These tools are heavier but shine when others falter. A practical workflow could be: try Docling/MarkItDown first – if you notice the Markdown is missing pieces (e.g. a table turned into a mess of text, or a two-column text came out jumbled), then switch to Marker for that file or set of files. Marker can be run on specific troublesome files (it even has a page-range option if only certain pages are problematic​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=%2A%20%60,additional%20logging%20and%20diagnostic%20information)). You might use Marker for all PDFs if they are known to be complex (research papers), while using a faster tool for simpler docs. Remember to allocate hardware accordingly; perhaps run Marker overnight on a GPU server if processing hundreds of files. The output Markdown from Marker/MinerU will likely need no further cleaning – you can directly feed it into the LLM or an embedding database. Just be mindful of size: a 100-page PDF will result in a very large Markdown file. You may want to split that by sections or pages before ingestion (Marker doesn’t chunk by itself, but you can post-process its output by splitting on `#` headings or certain tokens, for example).
			- **Large-scale or automated pipelines:** If you plan to integrate this conversion into a larger system (say, an automated data ingestion pipeline that runs whenever new files are added), both **Docling** and **MarkItDown** have Python APIs you can call from your code​[github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown#:~:text=Basic%20usage%20in%20Python%3A)​[pymupdf.readthedocs.io](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm#:~:text=For%20Office%20document%20support%2C%20PyMuPDF4LLM,with%20Office%20documents%20as%20expected). Docling’s `DocumentConverter` can be invoked on each file programmatically (and even in an async fashion for speed), and MarkItDown’s library can be imported to convert files in-memory. This might be preferable to calling subprocesses for each file if you want to avoid I/O overhead. Additionally, Docling’s integration with frameworks means you can directly create LangChain Document objects from its output​[medium.com](https://medium.com/@onur.sakar1997/document-processing-and-query-automation-with-ibm-docling-converting-to-markdown-and-json-with-4f318257669a#:~:text=popular%20document%20formats%2C%20including%20PDFs%2C,information%20retrieval%20and%20RAG%20applications), which is convenient for building an LLM indexing pipeline. In an automated setting with ongoing document ingestion, consider using these programmatic interfaces and add a step to **store metadata** (like original file name, creation date) in the Markdown or as YAML frontmatter. Some tools don’t do that by default, but you can easily prepend it; this helps trace answers an LLM gives back to the source document.
			- **Using cloud services or paid solutions:** If installing and managing these tools is not feasible (for example, you’re on a restricted machine or the volume is small but the content is very tricky), you could use **Azure Document Intelligence’s Layout model** via its API. Microsoft’s cloud will handle PDF, DOCX, PPTX analysis and return a Markdown string for the content​[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78339110/is-there-a-way-to-get-the-content-from-azure-document-intelligence-in-markdown-b#:~:text=3). The advantage is you get a highly robust parser with zero setup – it’s the same service behind Form Recognizer, so it’s enterprise-grade. The Markdown it returns is typically well-structured and includes tables (formatted in Markdown) and basic styling. You might still need to insert image links manually, as the API will not host images – but it can give coordinates or references for images if needed. The downside is cost: you pay per page processed, and you must send your documents to the cloud (which may be a security concern for sensitive data). A hybrid approach could be using MarkItDown locally and only falling back to Azure for files that MarkItDown flags as problematic. Likewise, other paid APIs like **Google Document AI or Amazon Textract** could be used, but they often output JSON rather than Markdown, requiring a custom conversion layer. Azure’s ability to output markdown directly is a unique convenience in this context.
			- **Post-processing and consolidation:** After conversion, you might have a lot of Markdown files – one per input document (e.g., each PPTX becomes a Markdown outlining all slides, each PDF becomes a long Markdown text). Depending on your use case, you may want to **consolidate** these or condense them. For ingestion into an LLM, if you plan to prompt the model on the entire directory content, you could concatenate Markdown files together (perhaps demarcating with big headings or page breaks). Tools like RepoMix have taken the approach of combining everything into one file, but be cautious: a huge Markdown file could exceed token limits. Often, a better strategy is to keep them separate and use a retrieval approach: embed each Markdown file or section and have the LLM retrieve relevant pieces. If you do need one big file (for instance, to feed into a context window of a model like Claude that can handle very large inputs), you can simply cat them in order – since all are in Markdown, the result will remain a valid Markdown document. You might want to sort by some logical order (perhaps alphabetically by file name or by document type). Also consider adding a table of contents or at least section titles (maybe the file name as a heading before each content) to help the LLM navigate it.
			- **Quality checks:** Regardless of the tool, it’s good to spot-check the output. Look at a few converted Markdown files and ensure that important elements like titles, section headings, lists, and tables look correct in Markdown syntax. If something like a table is misaligned, you might adjust parameters (for example, Marker allows using a dedicated table-only converter if you only care about tables​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=%2A%20%60,options%20then%20are%20listed%20above)). Check that images are indeed extracted and referenced (the tools usually save images to an output folder – ensure those files exist so the references aren’t broken). Ensuring that extraneous text (like repeated headers/footers on each page of a PDF) is removed can greatly improve LLM consumption – Marker does this automatically​[github.com](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker#:~:text=,on%20GPU%2C%20CPU%2C%20or%20MPS), and Docling/MarkItDown usually do, but if you see remnants you might need to clean them manually or with a script.
			- In summary, a **recommended workflow** for a typical user might be:
				- **Use Docling or MarkItDown for initial conversion** of all files in the directory to Markdown (leveraging their batch processing via scripting). This covers most cases with minimal effort.
				- **Apply Marker/MinerU selectively** for documents that need superior handling (e.g., ones with heavy math or complicated formatting). Replace those Markdown outputs or even merge them with the initial ones as needed.
				- **Incorporate image captions** by enabling LLM-powered description in MarkItDown/Marker or using a separate vision model, if the images carry information important to your use case.
				- **Consolidate or index** the Markdown outputs as appropriate for your LLM. For Q&A or search, indexing each Markdown separately is powerful. For direct prompting (e.g., “Here is a manual in Markdown, answer questions from it”), you might join a few files together if they are small, or just feed the relevant one. Optionally, run a summarization step to create an abridged version of each document – some users create two sets of files: one full detail Markdown and one condensed summary Markdown, and use the summary for high-level queries while keeping the full one for deep dives.
			- By leveraging these tools, you can automate the heavy lifting of converting an entire knowledge repository into LLM-ready text. Each tool has its niche: **Docling** and **MarkItDown** for ease and general use, **Marker** and **MinerU** for maximal accuracy, and cloud services like **Azure’s Document Intelligence** for a hassle-free but paid solution. With this toolkit, converting a folder of PDFs, DOCXs, and PPTXs into structured Markdown becomes a reproducible, efficient process – paving the way for GPT-based models to ingest and reason over the content effectively.
