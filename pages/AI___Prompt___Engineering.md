alias:: [[Prompt Engineering]]

- # Prompt Engineering
	- ## Overview
		- Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing prompts to effectively communicate with [[AI/LLM]]s
		- It involves crafting input text that guides the model to produce desired outputs
	- ## Key Techniques
		- ### [[AI/Prompt Engineering/Technique/Few-Shot Prompting]]
			- Providing examples to demonstrate the desired input-output pattern
		- ### [[Zero-Shot Prompting]]
			- Providing instructions without examples
		- ### [[Chain-of-Thought Prompting]]
			- Encouraging step-by-step reasoning
	- ## Related Concepts
		- [[Context Engineering]] - Broader approach to providing appropriate context to LLMs
