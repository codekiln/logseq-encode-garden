# [Managing your personal access tokens - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
	- ## About PATs
		- Personal access tokens are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the [GitHub API](/en/rest/overview/authenticating-to-the-rest-api) or the [command line](#using-a-personal-access-token-on-the-command-line).
		- Personal access tokens are intended to access GitHub resources on behalf of yourself.
		- To access resources on behalf of an organization, or for long-lived integrations, you should use a GitHub App. For more information, see [About creating GitHub Apps](/en/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/about-creating-github-apps).
		- ### [Types of personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#types-of-personal-access-tokens)
			- GitHub currently supports **two types of personal access tokens**:
				- fine-grained personal access tokens
				- personal access tokens (classic)
			- ==GitHub recommends that you use [[GitHub Fine-Grained PAT]]s instead of [[GitHub Personal Access Token (Classic)]] whenever possible.==
