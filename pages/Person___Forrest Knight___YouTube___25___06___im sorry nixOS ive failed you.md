# [i'm sorry nixOS, i've failed you. maybe next time. - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMxTTTBZhYM) [[Nix/OS]]
	- ## [[My Notes]]
		- A key take-away for me is that the NixOS paradigm conflicts with the auto-updaters of big IDEs like [[VSCode]], [[JetBrains]], [[Windsurf]]. Every time the OS has an update, it requires Nix-OS-specific workarounds. As a result, Forrest moved from NixOS to [[omakub]], which is [[Person/David Heinemeier Hansson]]'s opinionated [[Ubuntu]] setup. Given Forrest's prior affection for [[ArchLinux]], he's closely watching DHH's [[Omarchy]].
	- ## [[AI Notes]] from highlights #Snipd
		- Early days were great: you customized NixOS (Hyperland, NeoVim, Waybar) in ~6h42m and loved the declarative, rollbackable setup that kept everything intentional and versioned, as noted in your highlights about the “first weeks of NixOS bliss” and declarative configs’ benefits ([setup journey](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953579876), [why declarative clicked](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953579970)).
		- Friction emerged with constant updates: JetBrains, Zed, and Windsurf updates repeatedly broke or required deep config debugging, turning simple updates into time sinks ([update pain](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953580120), [JetBrains breaking](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953580062)).
		- Software install hurdles: many tools needed unstable packages or custom flakes; common CLIs like Bun/FlyCTL required extra config and dependency wrangling ([install issues](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953580071)).
		- Tinkering shifted from fun to forced: you enjoy polishing, but NixOS made you tinker just to keep basics working, eating time you wanted for coding and experiments ([tinkering time sink](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953580155), [preference shift](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953580178)).
		- You ultimately wiped NixOS and moved to Ubuntu, first pushing your Nix config to GitHub; Ubuntu felt reliably “just works” for your workflow ([switch to Ubuntu](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953580793)).
		- [[omakub]] (by [[Person/DHH]]) gave you a one-command, polished dev setup you could easily tweak (themes, shell tools), letting you iterate without break-fixing ([Omakube discovery](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953580716), [why starter script helped](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953581204)).
		- Takeaway: NixOS is great, just not right for your current time budget—you want low-friction tools that let you explore fast, while still respecting NixOS’s strengths ([reflection on fit](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953581232), [tool choice depends on time](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953581233), [match distro to time](https://readwise.io/bookreview/55995411/?highlight=953581234)).
