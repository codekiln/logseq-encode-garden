	- ### intro
		- This repository contains a structured system for managing and implementing Cursor AI rules that enhance code quality, maintain consistency, and automate development workflows.
	- ### Overview
		- The Cursor Rules System is a powerful framework that allows you to define, manage, and enforce coding standards, documentation requirements, and development workflows through AI-assisted rules. Each rule is defined in a `.mdc` file format that combines frontmatter configuration with XML-based rule definitions.
