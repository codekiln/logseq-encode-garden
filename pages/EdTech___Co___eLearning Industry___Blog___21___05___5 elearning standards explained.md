	- See also: [[EdTech/Idea/LearnMark/Q/What precedents exist for LMS-agnostic format]]
	- ## Key Standards Covered
		- ### [[SCORM]]
			- The oldest and most widely adopted standard
			- Developed by [[US/Gov/ADL]] in early 2000s
			- Enables content portability across [[LMS]]s
			- Two main versions still in use:
				- SCORM 1.2 (most common)
				- SCORM 2004 (adds sequencing)
		- ### [[AICC]]
			- One of the earliest eLearning standards
			- Created by the Aviation Industry CBT Committee
			- Laid groundwork for later standards
			- Dissolved in 2014, but influenced [[cmi5]]
		- ### [[xAPI]] (Experience API)
			- Modern successor to SCORM
			- Focuses on tracking learning experiences
			- More flexible than SCORM:
				- Works outside the browser
				- Supports mobile learning
				- Can track informal learning
			- Uses [[xAPI/LRS]] to store learning data
		- ### [[cmi5]]
			- Combines best of SCORM and xAPI
			- Created by [[AICC]] and [[US/Gov/ADL]]
			- Provides standardized launch mechanism
			- Uses xAPI for tracking
			- Growing adoption in modern systems
		- ### [[IMS/Common Cartridge]]
			- Developed by [[1EdTech]] (formerly IMS Global)
			- Popular in academic settings
			- Supports various content types:
				- Course materials
				- [[IMS/QTI]] assessments
				- Discussion prompts
				- External tools via [[LTI]]
	- ## Standard Selection Guidance
		- Choose [[SCORM]] for:
			- Traditional self-paced eLearning
			- Maximum LMS compatibility
			- Simple completion tracking
		- Choose [[xAPI]] for:
			- Modern, mobile-first learning
			- Detailed analytics needs
			- Learning outside the LMS
		- Choose [[cmi5]] for:
			- New projects needing SCORM-like features
			- xAPI tracking requirements
			- Future-proofing content
		- Choose [[IMS/Common Cartridge]] for:
			- Academic course materials
			- Content sharing between institutions
			- Integration with publisher content
	- ## Future Trends
		- Moving away from SCORM toward xAPI/cmi5
		- Increased focus on analytics and tracking
		- Growing need for mobile compatibility
		- Emphasis on interoperability between systems
