# Serie 410 `ICMC.586` 6'
	- ## My Notes
		- Didn't connect with me. It kind of made me think about terroception though - but in the sense of what it would be like for the piano. Echoey piano with reversed samples. Not performed; pre-recorded.

	- ## Description
		- **Serie 410** is an acousmatic piece that explores the boundary between real and virtual by proposing to listen to sounds organized according to a typically instrumental language. Art and technology therefore become means to falsify reality by suggesting as real something that is instead the result of technological manipulation. The piece also proposes a diagonal crossing of the different categories of electronic compositions in use today. Indeed this acousmatic work could also be perceived as a recording of a piece for mixed media or even for instruments and live electronics.
		- Serie 410 was born from the recording of a [[Instrument/Piano]] improvisation made using a twelve-tone series as musical material. The recording was superimposed on a copy of it played backwards. The sounds of the piano dialogue with percussion sounds, also elaborated with electronic means, to create small iridescent sound universes
