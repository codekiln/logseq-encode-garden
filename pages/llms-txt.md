			- > specifically `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`. These files allow large language models (LLMs) and agents to access programming documentation and APIs, particularly useful within integrated development environments (IDEs).
			- > As of March 9, 2025, IDEs do not yet have robust native support for llms.txt. However, you can still use llms.txt effectively through an MCP server.
			- > We provide anÂ **MCP server**Â that was designed to serve documentation for LLMs and IDEs:
			- > ğŸ‘‰Â  [[LangChain/GitHub/mpcdoc]]
			- > This MCP server allows integratingÂ `llms.txt`Â into tools likeÂ **Cursor**,Â **Windsurf**,Â **Claude**, andÂ **Claude Code**.
			- > ğŸ“˜Â **Setup instructions and usage examples**Â are available in the repository.
