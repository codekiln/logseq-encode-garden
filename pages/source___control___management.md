- Source Control Management (SCM)
	- SCM is the practice of applying tools that provide the ability to apply [[Version/Control]] to [[Code]].
	- The most popular [[CLI/Tool]] for this is [[git]], but other tools exist, such as [[mercurial]], [[svn]], [[cvs]].
	- The root abstraction of most of these tools is the [[Repository]], which is typically a single coding project.
