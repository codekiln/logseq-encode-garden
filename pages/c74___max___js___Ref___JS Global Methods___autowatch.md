	- > Turns on the automatic file recompilation feature where a file is reloaded and recompiled if it changes. This is particularly useful during development of your Javascript code if you have several [js](https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/refpages/js) instances using the same source file and you want them all to update when the source changes. It can also be used to facilitate the use of an external text editor. When the text editor saves the file, the [js](https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/refpages/js) object will notice and recompile it. By default, the value of autowatch is 0 (off). If you want to turn on autowatch, it is best to do so in your global code.
