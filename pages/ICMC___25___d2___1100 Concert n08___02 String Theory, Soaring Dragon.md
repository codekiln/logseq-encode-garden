		- Full Title: *<String Theory, Soaring Dragon> Composed for Guqin, Electronic Music, and AI*
		- ***String Theory, Soaring Dragon*** is written for guqin, electronic music, and AI. The inspiration for the work comes from String Theory in theoretical physics, which aims to explain the properties of all fundamental particles and forces through a unified theory and describe physical phenomena in the universe, including quantum mechanics and general relativity. The core idea of String Theory is that fundamental particles are composed of one-dimensional “strings,” with different vibrational modes corresponding to different subatomic particles. The guqin, one of the oldest stringed instruments in Chinese civilization, carries the excellent traditional culture of China and was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2003. The work combines String Theory in physics with the abstract imagery of guqin music in a hyperdimensional manner, creating a unique musical experience. Based on the traditional Chinese guqin piece “Longxiangcao,” the team developed a guqin traditional music dataset and used deep learning technology to train and generate new guqin music. Combined with electronic music and high-precision motion capture technology, the piece integrates human performers playing classical instruments, virtual instruments, and AI-generated guqin music into a multimedia presentation that combines audio-visual synesthesia and interactive sound and image elements. This organic fusion of real and virtual elements paints a future vision of the musical metaverse, showcasing the vitality and creativity of the Chinese nation, known as the “descendants of the dragon,” in the development of the musical metaverse.
