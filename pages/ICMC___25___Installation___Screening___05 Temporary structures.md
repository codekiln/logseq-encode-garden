		- 21:33 unbelievably creative. Unique. I've never seen anything like it. I think the piano is algorithmically created, and somehow the [[MIDI]] used to trigger it must have influenced the visual processing.

	- ## #Description
		- Temporary Structures are short works for piano and computer graphics that explore the connections between musical and visual lines. The piece uses algorithmic methods to seamlessly integrate musical and visual art, aiming for both fluidity and depth. In these two works, digital sculptural forms shift shape along coordinates defined by pitch, timing, and dynamics drawn from the musical gestures. This process creates a constantly evolving visual structure that reflects the music and is inspired by the philosophy and smooth forms of parametric architecture.
		- The premiere took place at the April in Santa Cruz Festival, where pianist Chia-Lin Yang performed alongside the accompanying computer graphics. The work has also been performed by pianist Eric Huebner at the Gassmann Electronic Music Series at UC Irvine, and by members of Dog Trio at the klub katarakt Festival for Experimental Music in Hamburg, Germany.
		- Beyond live performances, the work has been presented in various formats: as an installation featuring video and a synchronized Disklavier at the FFEMF Festival at the Crisp-Ellert Art Museum in Saint Augustine; as a wall-mounted video artwork at the Zeitgeist Gallery in Nashville and at the Performing Media Festival in South Bend, Indiana; and as a screening at WAVEFORMS, presented by the Museum of Science, Boston.

		- **Matt Schumaker**’s music engages with research into computer-assisted composition, interactive computer music with performers, and visual music. He received a doctorate in Music Composition from UC Berkeley (UCB), where he studied with Edmund Campion, David Wessel and others. Early on in his studies, Schumaker spent a formative year in Amsterdam, studying with Louis Andriessen. Later on, he spent a year in France through UCB’s Prix de Paris program, where he worked closely with Martin Matalon.
		  In recent years, Schumaker’s music has been performed by the UC Berkeley Symphony, Radius Ensemble, Dinosaur Annex, Winsor Music, New Music Works, Eco Ensemble, and the Left Coast Chamber Ensemble. Schumaker’s music has also been presented at festivals and curated events, including by clarinetist Rane Moore at the Virtual SICPP 2020, by pianist Chia- Lin Yang at the April in Santa Cruz Festival, by members of Dog Trio at the klub katarakt Festival for Experimental Music in Hamburg, Germany, by clarinetist Joshua Rubin at the soundSCAPE festival in Blonay, Switzerland, and by pianist Eric Huebner as part of the Gassmann Electronic Music Series at UC Irvine. Schumaker’s multimedia work for music and computer graphics has been shown at Zeitgeist Gallery in Nashville and at the Crisp-Ellert Art Museum in Saint Augustine.
		  From 2015-17, Schumaker was a Lecturer at UCB, teaching courses in computer music and music perception and cognition. During 2018-20, he was a Martin Luther King, Jr. Visiting Scholar at MIT. In fall 2021, he joined the Music Department at UC Santa Cruz as assistant professor.
