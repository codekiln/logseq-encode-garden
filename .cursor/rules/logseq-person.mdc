# How a Person is tracked in this Logseq knowledge garden
This is an extension to [logseq-flavored-markdown](mdc:.cursor/rules/logseq-flavored-markdown.mdc) for recording information about a person.

A person entry is a logseq page where [[Person/Full Name]] corresponds to `pages/Person___Full Name.md`. 

If you are asked to make an entry for a person, you should do a search
* search in `pages/Person___*.md` to find if a person already exists
* if it already exists, then you should **update** the existing entry
  * a single person should not have more than one person page
* look up the person on the internet
  * create a person page for them 
  * link the person and a bit of their bio in their page
  * if possible add an image link
* if the person page is new, make an entry in today's journal page that links to that person.
