# Overview of Logseq

* Logseq is a privacy-first, open-source platform for knowledge management. 
* A Logseq graph is a collection of markdown files and linked assets. 
* Logseq is different from other markdown-based knowledge systems like Obsidian because it uses a block-centric approach with infinite nesting. Each block inherits the tags of its parent blocks. This relies on the unordere list item in markdown. Logseq uses a special flavor of markdown. 
* See the Logseq Flavored Markdown cursor project rule in [logseq-flavored-markdown.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/logseq-cursor-rules/logseq-flavored-markdown.mdc).
* See Logseq Directory Structure cursor project rule in [logseq-directory-structure.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/logseq-cursor-rules/logseq-directory-structure.mdc).
* See the Logseq Asset Linker cursor project rule in [logseq-asset-linker.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/logseq-cursor-rules/logseq-asset-linker.mdc).
* If you have access to a GitHub MCP server, then you can query documentation about logseq at the public https://github.com/logseq/docs, especially in the `pages` subdirectory.
