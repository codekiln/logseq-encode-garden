# Rules to follow when outputting markdown
If you nest fenced code blocks in markdown, it will break the rendering. It's important that there is only one level of triple-backtick fenced code blocks in markdown output. Place your response in a triple-backtick fenced codeblock that's labeled with markdown, and use triple tilde fenced codeblocks for any inner code blocks, as per the CommonMark spec.

~~~
  $> git describe --tags  
~~~
