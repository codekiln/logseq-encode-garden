- Slides should follow this structure precisely:
	- Each markdown **unordered list item** (`-`) at the top level is treated as a section title (rendered as H2).
	- Nested markdown unordered list items (`\t-`) represent individual slides. 
	- Each slide should have multiple bullet points `*` clearly describing the topic.
	- Include an image relevant to the slide content, following a 16:9 aspect ratio:
		- For slides containing **fewer than 10 words**, images can be up to `680px` wide.
		- For slides containing **more than 10 words**, images should be approximately **400px** wide.
- Prefer concise but clear bullet points on each slide. 
- Example slide formatting:

~~~markdown
	- ## MCP Composability & [Sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/sampling)
	  * Every MCP client can be an MCP Server.
	  * [[MCP/Sampling]] allows **servers to request inference** from clients, ensuring **control of privacy and cost**.

~~~

- Use consistent image aspect ratios across slides, preferably **16:9**.
- Keep each slide self-contained: one image, clear bullets, one coherent message.
- Don't break a single slide up into multiple slides by using hyphens rather than `*`. 

The following is three slides (three `-`)
<COUNTER_EXAMPLE>
```markdown
	- ## MCP Inspector & OAuth Authentication
		- Inspector provides debugging for MCP connections.
		- OAuth integration simplifies secure service authentication. Scoped permission boundaries can apply.

```

The following is a single slide (one `-`):

	- ## MCP Inspector & OAuth Authentication
	  * Inspector provides debugging for MCP connections.
	  * OAuth integration simplifies secure service authentication. Scoped permission boundaries can apply.
