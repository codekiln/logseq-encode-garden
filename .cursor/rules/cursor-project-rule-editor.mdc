# Cursor Project Rule Editor Rule

`.mdc` files stand for Mark Down Cursor, and are meant to give the Cursor IDE AI Agent context on how to operate in the codebase.
This particular rule is about using the AI to author and edit `.mdc` files, so as to update the rules.
This rule ensures `.mdc` files are correctly placed within a repository and adhere to standard formatting conventions.

## Cursor Project Rule Placement

Rules for placing and organizing Cursor rule files in the repository.

<rule>
name: cursor_rules_location
description: Standards for placing Cursor rule files in the correct directory
filters:
  # Match any .mdc files
  - type: file_extension
    pattern: "\\.mdc$"
  # Match files that look like Cursor rules
  - type: content
    pattern: "(?s)<rule>.*?</rule>"
  # Match file creation events
  - type: event
    pattern: "file_create"

actions:
  - type: reject
    conditions:
      - pattern: "^(?!\\.\\/\\.cursor\\/rules\\/.*\\.mdc$)"
        message: "Cursor rule files (.mdc) must be placed in the .cursor/rules directory"

  - type: suggest
    message: |
      When creating Cursor rules:

      1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         ├── another-rule.mdc
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use kebab-case for filenames
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

      3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. Never place rule files:
         - In the project root
         - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
         - In any other location

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Rule file in wrong location
      rules/my-rule.mdc
      my-rule.mdc
      .rules/my-rule.mdc

      # Good: Rule file in correct location
      .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
    output: "Correctly placed Cursor rule file"

## Cursor Project Rule Markdown Formatting Standards

Rules for ensuring `.mdc` files adhere to proper Markdown formatting.

<rule>
name: markdown_format_standard
description: Ensures correct formatting and link structure in `.mdc` files.
filters:
  - type: file_extension
    pattern: "\\.mdc$"
  - type: content
    pattern: "(?s)^---\\n.*?\\n---\\n"

actions:
  - type: suggest
    message: |
      Markdown `.mdc` files should:
      
      1. **Include a frontmatter block** at the top with a `description` field:
         ```
         ---
         description: "Description of the rule"
         globs: "*.mdc"
         ---
         ```
      
      2. **Use `mdc:` links** for file references, constructing a relative link from the PROJECT_ROOT to the file
         ```
         [example.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/example.mdc)
         ```

      3. **Use proper headers** (`#`, `##`, `###`) and avoid inconsistent formatting.

examples:
  - input: |
      ---
      description: "Example rule for formatting"
      ---
      # Sample Rule
      This rule enforces correct `.mdc` formatting.
    output: "Correctly formatted `.mdc` file"
